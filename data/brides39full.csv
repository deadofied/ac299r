"I am an easy going straight forward person, been in Bombay since the last 9 years leading the human resource function for a financial services firm. Earlier, I have had the opportunity of living in various cities across the country, moving every few years since dad was in the army. I have thoroughly enjoyed that experience and also now of settling in one place, setting up my house etc though love of exploring new places still remains. I believe in living life as it comes and am not much of a future planner. I quite like my independence and need my space. I believe that understanding and mutual respect are most important for 2 people to connect. Once the wavelength is there, a relationship can be developed. Was not very convinced about this virtual medium to make friends or meet meaningful people but some of my close friends have met some nice people through this site, so thought of exploring this option.","As mentioned in my profile, I believe that understanding and mutual respect are most important for 2 people to connect.

I am not boasting but my presence lights up the group I am in. I have always had this quality. Since childhood, people have been telling me about this. My charisma is one of the best things I have. This has helped me make many friends. I not only feel proud but also happy that I have something that attracts people towards me. Apart from that, an interest in languages brought up by the fluency. A simple hard work in understanding the day to day practice gave me a much better confidence in my personality. I feel happy that I got what I aimed for.

In future, I want to excel in the same field and grow professionally. I love reading. I think it is a nice way to learn. A passion which I inherited from my mother is cooking. I love trying different types of cuisine. A vegetarian by choice, I like creating continental dishes. An interest in simple things in life like art, handicraft and theater is something I cherish and works as a stress buster.","I have been brought up in a nuclear family with a small close knit affair.

"I believe that a simple life is best for everyone as it guides you to eliminate the unnecessary things from your life.

My mother is a housewife and father is a Sr. Manager of a reputed Engineering firm. After my school education, I completed my B Sc (Honors) from Calcutta University and CA Certificate. Whenever I get time from work I like to do the household works and cook. I also like to drive, listen to music and read novels. I have very few friends and like to spend most of my time with them. My nature is that of a very caring person and I care about my friends a lot.","Like every girl even I have some desires regarding my life partner. Most importantly he should be a nice human being. I have no problems in marrying a person from any profession. He should be well settled so that he can take care of me properly. 
I want my life partner to be well educated and qualified so that he can understand my perspective towards life. Every parent wants their girl to be married in a good family so as mine. My husband should come from a good family background and they must have a decent image in the society. 
According to me a there should be transparency between a couple and I want my husband to be honest with me. This way we can avoid unnecessary misunderstandings between us. He should give sheer importance to elders and must respect them. This way I will be able to respect him as well as his family and the elderly members. 
My major weakness is that I am very emotional so I want my life partner to know about it. He should take care of this fact. I want him to understand me and make me strong enough to face the world. If he is like this then I will give him all my love.

We are one music loving family  that simply loves to travel.

I am basically a middle mgmt professional and looking for a friend for life time. I consider myself as a self respecting and understanding lady and looking for similar profile to match. I am career oriented but at the same time not too ambitious in my life. I believe everything happens at its own pace. I need a companion who is fun to be with and knows what he wants in his life. Personal space in my opinion is required for everyone of us. 

I am not a very traditional girl but at the same time not so modern. I respect the culture &amp;  traditions but choose not to follow them rigidly. I consider these are based on the personal choice of an individual or a couple. 

In my life, my parents and my friends are very much important. I have two elder sisters and they are also like my friends. I am looking for my soul mate through this website.

"""Hi, you r at a profile of a gal who is smart, confident, practical and of course intelligent. I have a positive attitude towards life and want to live it to the fullest. Since, I've worked in global market and met challanges enforcing to embibe that the change is essential &amp; only mantra for survival is change through innovation, so it also shaped my thinking towards life. Things which used to work earlier are becoming redundant in fast changing environment. Now our personal life has entered into a phase which also requires major change through innovative ways for better alignment with time otherwise we wuld n't be able to catch up and remain haunting with forced bachelor hood, so people still in same old mode of thinking may fail to recognize demand of the time and doom to fail Looks alarming ! Of course not. If you r confident, realistic, ready to set examples, ready to think afresh, ready to transform from old bad phases, ready to innovate by breaking all pseudo boundaries, ready to explore happiness in life without any complexity, then you r at profile of a right partner can contact me &amp; join me in a happy journey called life.
