"I am keen to start the second phase of my life, and am in search of the right woman to share my life with and form a true partnership, you know the kind of bond that makes people green. ideally, you will be pretty, lot of fun, educate and working, and someone who truly enjoys living a full and adventurous life.

I believe I am a leveled-headed guy, hardworking, well educated, and very clean individual who enjoys having fun, the good things life has to offer, and making a woman happy. I also think I have a huge heart and I am a very affectionate and passionate person with a great sense of humor. I'm pretty transparent and communicate well and often, and will say what I mean, and mean what I say. What I think you will be: Feminine, classy, confident, uninhibited, playful, smart, beautiful, fit, sweet and decisive and yet God fearing (open to any religion etc!). You will love to dress up, but are not afraid to break a nail. I guess you are also in good shape and have the self-discipline and motivation it takes to stay that way. And, to top it all, I am sure you will be a typical Lady. Giving, warm, affectionate, romantic, loyal, emotional, fashionable, loves to kiss and be held. I am the type of guy who is looking to settle down but with all the fun/spontaneity of a relationship. Like, I would love Sunday mornings in bed together reading the newspaper, enjoying a cup of coffee, and cuddling, knowing that someone is always there for you; thinking about that other person as you get through your work day, knowing that you're coming home to them, Testing them when the workday gets especially boring.

,"I would like my partner to be a soft-spoken person with caring and helpful attitude for all. She should believe in family values, love children and like going out and having fun with family and friends. Carefree and fun loving nature with cosmopolitan upbringing would be a great plus. Whether she wants to work or not or want to do entrepreneurial activity would be entirely her choice. She would find a true friend in me who would always stand by her decision provided they are not self centered. She should understand and reciprocate tender feeling of love, compassion, affection and forgiveness to make the union really divine.
