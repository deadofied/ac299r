He will appear for third USMLE exam in mid Sept 13 and apply for residency in US universities. He will again be in US from November 13 for the purpose of interviews to these universities. With God?s blessing, if he gets residency to any US University, it will be a three year residency starting from July 14. Till he gets that, I have to be with him. After that he will be on his own and too busy to be part of my daily life. After completing residency he can work in US as a doctor and wants to settled in US. Since he is the only family I have, and as I have no other responsibility to fulfill here in India, I wish to remain attached to him and near him.

"A person feels blessed if he has many qualities, but it rarely happens that way. However, it feels amazing and they feel they are different from others and are perfect.
I am one of those persons and the people who know me complement me for the same. I possess many qualities like being convincing, patient, sincere, hardworking, and honest, and that is why I am in the good books of many people. They adore me and like me because of the same.
I lost my father which was the biggest loss of my life. My mother is a homemaker and both my brothers are happily married. I am very close to my family and we consider our mother responsible for everything good that has happened in our lives. I am sure both my parents will bless me in whatever I do. 
I am a Manager and have been working for a long time. In future, I would like to excel in the same field. My experience will help me in achieving what I have aimed. 
I have many friends and they all are dear to me. I spend as much time as I can with them. They are always there to help me and also provide me with an emotional support. 
Whenever I am free, I like to cook and people admire me for that, which makes me very happy. I also like to read.","I want to be very specific about one thing. The man I get married to must be well educated and should be settled in Delhi. Both my brothers are Doctors and I know how to deal with things in such an environment. Also, I would like to live in Delhi in future because I am quite familiar with the place and can adjust well in that place. 
He should be very simple as I appreciate simplicity. He should also be very honest and loyal, which will make our relationship stronger and long lasting. He should accept me as I am and should not try to change me. 
I am both traditional and modern as a person. This will be an advantage as he can adjust with me easily because I wouldnAa?a?t mind him being either of them.
His family should be well reputed in the society, as my family will appreciate that. This way they can feel compatible with each other, as well as, can respect and trust one another, which will help in forming a healthy relation amongst them. 
As I mentioned above, I like cooking. I have even done graduation in Food and Nutrition. I hope he does not mind this hobby of mine. I am sure once he knows how much I enjoy that, he will also be proud of me. 
I am sure I will get what I desire in a man. When I get married to my dream man, I will fill our life with happiness.  ",,44 to 50,20 Jun 1962,12:45:00,India,Delhi,Slim,Doesn't Matter,,Agarwal,,Delhi,,Very Fair ,Doesn't Matter,Sister,M.Sc. (Science),"51 yrs, 5ft,<br />

"I am a retired high school English teacher. I was not born in India but I have strong Indian samskaras. I have been to India 6 times.I love to sing kirtan and I also am well versed in Bollywood movies. I enjoy spiritual activities. I have a Guru since 1978. I am seeking a kind, gentle man who is young at heart, loves to laugh, and who does not to be bossy, since I am quite independent, so I would not be happy if someone needed to tell me what to do. I am a very cheerful person by nature, and I sing a lot. I am very youthful and love all the beautiful simple things in life. I would like an easy-going companion who has his own interests and independence as well, basically a progressive mentality but he must love God and have a spiritual focus in his life and enjoy his Indian heritage. As hobbies, I like to garden. I have beautiful roses and lillies on the back deck. I have fair skin, red hair, blue eyes and wear a diamond stud in my nose.(I really enjoy wearing Indian dress when I go to a festival or spiritual program. I've done quite a bit of traveling, especially all over India. I have been to Kedarnath, Badrinath, Rishikesh, Haridwar, Mathura, Srinigar, Jaipur, Udaipur, Uttar Kashi, Delhi, Ahmadabad, Mt. Abu, Kolkata, Mumbai, Mayapur, Vrindaban and Ganeshpuri. Maybe some other places, but that's enough for now. I sing a lot, like to dance, am learning harmonium, I so love music, but these days it is mostly kirtan.

"DONOT WANT SOMEONE TO JUST LIVE WITH I WANT SOME ONE I CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT..... I AM .. EDUCATED, EASY GOING ,SOCIAL,PRESENTABLE AND FIT WITH HAPPY PERSONALITY
What I do not want  2  be anymore...I won't be the woman that you shape and mold into what you think I should be. And then when you discover what i truly am...you run for the hills...with the self comforting crap about *still being friends.*

I do  NOT  want to be *the other woman* because your marriage has something missing. And you think i can be some kind of miracle drug. And then when you think it's getting too *real* you run for the hills...with the self comforting crap about *still being friends.*

What I will be is ME. A strong, fun, passionate , somewhat crazy woman  who speaks her mind. Who likes to laugh and play. Who wants someone in her life who is strong and fun and likes to play. And he is ALL hers!! Meaning when he says he's in her life...HE'S IN HER LIFE.

There is a garden in every childhood, an enchanted place where colors are brighter, the air softer, and the morning more fragrant than ever again. If ur looking for the same.........."," Tell me have u ever imagined the worst possible outcome to a situation you were experiencing and have said "" I knew this wud happen "" when something went wrong in ur life ? 
If u answered yes u r using the powerful force of ur thoughts to create things u do not desire , thinking is usually a mixture of words , sentences , mental images and sensations and our thoughts  are creating the way we don't want it to be .
 
Logic is straight forward , if our thoughts are creating r universe in a way we don't want it to be , can't they also create our universe in a way we do want it to be . As simple as this thought is , the paradigm shift from negative to positive is incredibly challenging .
 
Guess it depends on how we percieve and react, I question my basic beliefs, and the ans is create your life as I want it to be . Eventually I realise I am the author of my destiny, material emotional , no matter who we are , where we live or what we do .
 
We face inumerable hurdles on our way to achieve our goals be it job , more wealth, right partner or perfect health . some of us say we are just not lucky,some say beyond our control.
whatever  r reasons for not having made it in life ""STOP THINKING"" and WORRYING [ MOST NEVER HAPPEN]
 
It seems that most people let thoughts connected with worries , fears anger or unhappiness occupy their mind most of the time . These limiting  beliefs , are in fact what prevent us from being lucky rich or whater else . Blaming circumstances for these probs is useless coz we are responsible for them . This tells us we have the power to create what we want  yeah ???.
 
So I have decided will simplyfy n  manfest my reality day to day life . Will stop worring and thinking about my future .
 
So what do u think would like to know ur thoughts.

 Belief in  creating  our own happiness and universe

"myself as broadminded, down to earth, kind, understanding, helpful, honest, trust-worthy, sensitive &amp; caring girl. But the best thing to do would be that you should judge yourself.

Here is a glimpse of my ideology in a few lines. That is what I believe and says. A person is not judged out of what he or she gets in life rather what he or she makes out of life given all the circumstances Life is never a bed of roses rather is full of challenges, for some early in life whereas for others somewhere later in life. I am amongst those who believe in facing those challenges of life with a smile on face and come out of it turning into a stronger personality. I strongly believe in truthfulness, honesty and loyalty to be the basics of every relationship. I respect every individual who have faith in their own hard-work since I myself belong to this category. I have a strong reverence for Indian traditions and culture though I equally respect western culture too. I hate dishonest people and people who are not straight forward.
