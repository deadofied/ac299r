Its very important to have an excellent understanding &amp; complete trust which can develop such a bond where both the partners can discuss anything under the sky with each other &amp; work together as a team. Once that level of maturity &amp; chemistry exist in a couple, everything else falls in place.","I am looking for a match who will make me feel complete and co-dependent and will feel the same with me.

"About me 
I am a simple ordinary balanced individual .i am presently working as business development manager in a automation and instrumentation company and based at noida.I am looking for a simple ,ordinary , balanced individual as my life partner .The most important attribute i am looking for in my life partner is a good human being above all else.. 
About my family 
my father is a retired diploma civil engineer
my mother is a housewife
my elder sister is a gynacologist(doctor) by profession and is married to a orthopaedic surgeon.
I belong to a ordinary lower middle class family .We could afford to follow a simple ordinary lifestyle .We are not sophisticated in our habits and persona.My mother do all household work like cooking food/washing clothes etc by his own hands(though a maid do work like cleaning utensils etc).My mother only understands Hindi Language (in reading/writing/understanding).My father can read and write English language but can not speak english language.I am also more comfortable in Hindi then in English.Though to a small extent I can also read/write/speak English Language(mostly with errors). All our family members take active interest in tending and rearing a small 300 sq metres garden in our house and we believe in slow pace of life.
About my education 
B.tech(electronics)
About my work  
Currently working us project marketing manager for a 'automation and process instrumentation company'.
Not a very bright career ahead.Very ordinary looking career ahead with low visibility of long term career graph.I am not a very highly qualified professional but at best can be described as semi-professional (mediocre).Previuosly I was in Indian Telecom Service Cadre in Bsnl.Then I switched to private sector thinking grass might be greener here.But now I have realized that I am not so bright and so accepted my likelyhood destiny as a mediocre individual with a ordinary career. 
About my desired partner 
When I myself is not very exceptional and on the top of it I carry a social stigma of being a divorcee,it would be not be fair on my part to desire much(perhaps I do not deserve to desire high)so I would say that somebody who feels good about her innerself,simple ,ordinary and who herself has not much high desires of her spouse (as ordinary person like me would perhaps be faultering in fulfilling her high desires ).I would prefer someone who likes cooking food ; does not dislike washing clothes;work.I would keenly await the expression of interest ,from anyone who would be interested in a ordinary person like me.",,,,23 Feb 1972,,India,,,,,Jat,,,Other Architecture/ Planning Institute,,,Self,Arts/ Graphic Designing,"41 yrs, 5ft 10in,<br />

"Hi

A romantic by heart who views life through rose coloured glasses; though can be quite practical too. 


Miracles do happen; believe in seeing the best in a person and definately believe second in chances.

Very strongly believe in fidelity, trust and steadfastness. 

A marriage, as I see it, is two people with different likes and dislikes, ideas and even personalities; who through love, understanding, adjustment and mutual respect jointly make a family unit far richer and more balanced than as single entities. Of course one of the most important ingrediants for me is humour.


If you agree, I'd love to get to know you better..","Looking for someone to help me smile through life. . .

"Hi, 
I am a bit optimistic and usually have a ready smile.

I believe very strongly in fidelity, trust and steadfastness.

I am quite romantic, tend to view life with rose coloured glasses at times; but when need be am as practical as I can be. 

Am selective in the company I keep and focus on friendships that matters.

Believe in God; though do not practice my religion in the very strict and traditional way. 

My hobbies and interests are quite eclectic.  They include reading, music, movies, theatre, pets, net surfing, travelling, solving crossword puzzles, su doku, etc.  

My preferred movies range from comedies, action / suspense, sci-fi &amp; fantasy, non-commercial / art, etc. Basically something which catches my fancy and engrosses me.","My idea of a partner is someone who can be strong for me as I for him; someone affectionate and caring. A soulmate whom I can adore and cherish.

A good marriage, as I understand it is two people with different likes and dislikes, ideas and even personalities; who through love, understanding, adjustment and mutual respect jointly make a family unit far richer and more balanced than as single entities.

So if you're interested do drop a line and we'll let God lead us ......",Both my parents have now retired. I have a great younger brother who is working for a multinational.

My leisure time interests are reading books, listening to music, travelling, watching movies &amp; T.V., net surfing,......and I love to chat &amp; hang out with friends.

"As a twenty-something, I may have heightened the anxiety level of my family members when I decided to set my personal priorities in the early '90s. My marriage certainly didn't figure at the top of the agenda at that time. 

I wanted to go out and explore the world. Conquer the space I would occupy in the months and years ahead. Achieve a certain degree of harmony with my surroundings. Take my decisions at a time of my own choosing. Focus on my professional skill-set. Be of use. Be confident. And be on my own.

I did not do this to scoff at the support structure of the immediate family and the larger clan which was available to me at all points of time. I value it as much now as I did then. I wanted to attain a level of professional recognition and success.

The present decade has brought all of these. God has been kind. Experience of different facets of life has brought maturity and perspective. The paradigm has shifted from the struggle for survival to stability and more success.

Perhaps a few more years have passed in the process of this achievement. Perhaps the probability of finding a life partner at age 36 has relatively diminished. But perhaps other human beings have gone through a similar cycle. 

I am now ready to carve out a shared destiny through marriage. One that will bring mutual joy and happiness. One that will be based on compassion and understanding. One that will kindle love. One that will have longevity.

I have had a happy childhood in Bombay with a family of migrants that came here from west Punjab in 1947. My father studied law at Bombay University and has been practicing it at the Bombay High Court for over 50 years.

My mother is a housewife who, besides me, has raised my elder brother to be a textile professional. It is a different matter that my brother has passionately followed his dream &amp; successfully switched his career to a technology-based occupation.

As a US resident, he now works for a New Jersey-based company and lives in the same state with his wife and two school-going children. My sister-in-law grew up in Bombay and now works for a renowned multi-national travel house in NYC.

After experimenting with my career choice initially, I have settled down as a computer software professional. I am presently employed by a Mumbai-based MNC as a Project Leader.

I have fewer interests because of paucity of time but I am passionate about the ones I have. I love dancing, aerobics, health gigs, music and shopping. I love to have long conversations with friends and family. I love to travel. I have had extended stay in UK, the US, Thailand and Muscat.","Looking for an educated, well settled, caring, honest and responsible person who does not drink or smoke.

"First of all thank you for viewing my profile. 
Myself:
Hi, I am Meenakshi Gurung, born and bought up in Dehra Dun, Uttaranchal and now working in Delhi since 2000. 
I am simple natured and take the life as it comes. But of course a bold person always ready to solve and come out of any kind of situation. According to me, internal beauty is more important than the physical appearance.
My family members and friends say I am a caring and lovable person. I believes in the truth ---- 'Live and let others live'. I use to spend my leisure time - reading articles/books, watching good movies, listening music, cooking, helping needy peoples and of course doing prayers for all. 
I feel marriage will happen as per the God's wish. It is an alliance of life, a meeting of two souls which is possible only through the full contribution and adjustment from the both to meet and march towards one life time journey. I start searching for my soul mate at this stage of life as I suppose myself to be confident to proceed forward to build a best nest of my coming life.
Family:
From my family front we are three sisters and I am the second one. We all three are working and my eldest sister is happily married. The younger sister still wants to make advancements in her career. My father is a enjoying his retired life at our Dehra Dun home and my mother is a simple and adorable house wife.
For the life partner:
I prefer my life partner to be loving, caring, responsible, honest and believe in life long relationship and respect for each others values.","For the life partner:

"I belong to a cultured, well settled, Bengali Brahmin family. Have grown up in an industrial town in Madhya Pradesh, and thereafter moved to metro cities. One younger brother, married with kids. Parents, retired.

I am a well placed professional, and have held senior positions very early in my life. I have enjoyed challenges that high pressure jobs throw up. But, I believe that in a professional life of roughly 40 years, people should try out various options. Thus, after completing my PhD (pursuing currently), I may like to move fulltime into academics, as I enjoy teaching, and this vocation provides more time for self and family. I have Masters in mathematics, and MBA. Have done a short course in management in UK on scholarship.

I am slim, good looking, and carry myself well. I look calm and collected, and generally at peace with the world. By nature, I am a happy person. Easygoing, smiling and filled with joie de vivre describes me best. Most likely, because of my nature and happy disposition, I donot look my age.

I live in a joint family, which includes kids. Strong middle class values, traditional yet modern outlook to life, love of learning and ability to reach out to the needy keeps me grounded. I am not very goal oriented as a person, rather I enjoy the journey of life.

I love travelling, reading, music, cooking, and keeping a good &amp; welcoming household. For my family, I continue to be the holiday planner, chief host cum cook for get-togethers, as well as navigator for weekend short travels!

I am planning to settle down with some one who is well qualified, financially well placed, belongs to a cultured family and most importantly, has a strong base of decent value system. Intelligent, jolly, ability to enjoy journey of life are the key qualities. Location is not a constraint; I can relocate easily. 

I believe that marriage is based on love and liking, but also on mutual trust, regard and respect for each other.","I am planning to settle down with some one who is well qualified, financially well placed, belongs to a cultured family and most importantly, has a strong base of decent value system.

"Dancing is a perpendicular expression of a horizontal desire. It needs nothing but a cause. No good dancer can dance if he has nothing in his mind. One needs to have a desire if one needs to dance perfectly.
I have always admired the idea of knowing how to dance. That is what motivated me to learn dancing. I got trained for some time and now I can dance without any hitch. Before that, I thought dancing needs to have a lot of dimensions and rules, but after learning it I realized how free and stress-free dancing is. It does not need any fix steps or forms. All it needs is desire to do it. 
Apart from being a Dancer, I am an Accountant and am quite good at my work. I have a very busy life but I take some time off from work and practice dancing whenever I am free. This level of dedication I have inherited from my parents and I am very happy to have them as my idols. 
My family is very close and very well bonded. I get a feeling of belongingness when I am around them. They make me feel I am worthy of a lot of love. 
Apart from that, I love decorating my house and enjoy it immensely. Whenever I am free at home, I start decorating my room. I have helped many friends of mine in decorating their houses. They like this in me and I am proud to have this as my hobby as it is very constructive.","I am a little bit short tempered so I want to marry a man who knows how to calm me down. He must know to improve peopleAA?A?s mood. A fun loving man will be my priority.
I love holidaying and I want him to possess the same hobby. I expect my partner to be very go-getter types. He shouldnAA?A?t be depressed and sad without any reason. I will appreciate his jolly good nature a lot.
As I mentioned I love dancing, so I would like him to have no problem with that at all. I will like to continue practicing this as it gives me happiness and confidence. I am sure, when he gathers that he will enjoy this hobby of mine.
I am very upfront and like to have open conversations with people whenever required. He must be the same, as I donAA?A?t want him to disrespect me in any way and think bad about me. 
I donAA?A?t have many friends and I will like to spend as much time as I can with him. He should understand this and try to be with me most of the times as I am sure he will enjoy my company. 
I want him to be very caring as I like caring and loving people. This will not only help me in getting adjusted to his family but he can enter my life happily too. 
With all this in him, I can assure him a wonderful life ahead. ",,39 to 44,27 Mar 1972,,India,,Doesn't Matter,,,Digambar,,,,Doesn't Matter,,Sister,B.A. (Arts),"41 yrs, 5ft 1in,<br />
