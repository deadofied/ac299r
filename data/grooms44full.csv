"Open minded, liberal in thought (but not in moral values) living, and learning. with each day as it comes... 
I like my life and as it is now I think its time to start sharing (or multiplying) it with someone.  I'm easy to get along unfussy with just about average living habits. 
Just need 4 walls, music, a functioning computer, a floor to sleep on and a square meal. And  my domestic needs are more than satisfied.
Have always been more interested in the functional aspect of things and phenomena rather than their appearances. 
LIkea good read or a movie, watch TV when I get the time. And yes Freinds is funny a lot of the time. THey seem to have really good writers on their staff there.
As for the rest of life, i believe that you either take it on the chin, or take it into your arms. Life will always go on! Make the right choices. 
I'm no poet, and i know it !! Oh I think I just blew it !!!
Sorry about this last bit. Have always professionally been into one form of communication medium or the other. Hence the prolixity of (perhaps) needless words.","Not a very demanding person, Oh what the the hell, would be disappointed however, if there weren't the occasional demands that I just don't get. And its beautiful !  Then full time attention and affection (just kidding at the last :). I have lived independently for a long time and enjoyed every moment (well almost every moment). 
Now would like to share that joy (and sorrrows, for evrynbody gets their fair share in life that need to be dealt with from time to time). But coming back to the joy, yes, I would now like to share (or rather,  multiply) it with a practicing dreamer. But more importantly, a woman with a zest for life. An appreciation of all the beautiful things life has to offer and a the chutzpah to go out there and get them (and the act of getting them itself may not be so beautiful sometimes).",,,10 Jun 1969,11:02:00,United Arab Emirates,Mumbai,Average,,,Sindhi,,,,Fair ,,Brother,BE B.Tech (Engineering),"44 yrs, 6ft,<br />

"I am a fun loving person who likes to travel a lot &amp; also has a passion for performing arts. A typical Libran, generally confident &amp; witty in my behavior. Flexibility is another asset because of which i tend to get along with people of all age groups and cultures. Not sounding too boastful but many of my friends consider me to be 'bindaas (care-free) types.... also Versatile. I warm up to a person easily but can cool off too, - fairly quickly.


God has adorned me with the gift of gab &amp; wit and I am a very expressive person. Friendly &amp; caring in general but rather candid at times. Never an audience. Always a player. always been a fighter in life ! Not routinely, but as a hobby, read a lot of books (fiction/non-fiction). Although it may seem difficult to believe from what you have read till now but I am very caring, forgiving and modest too. 


I have done pretty well for my self socially &amp; financially and off late have been feeling that its time that I found someone to share my dreams &amp; achievements with. Someone who would be the pivotal point for all things to come, around whom I may weave my plans for the future. Someone who can be my companion &amp; friend, to love and to cherish.....



My Job: Own a Company involved in the business of real estate development.","Looking for someone who is sincere, rational and grounded. An articulate person.... who is in tune with herself and has respect both for herself and others. Knows when to lead n when to follow &amp;   also how to walk hand-in-hand. A person uninfluenced by trends or popular opinion. Someone I can talk with &amp;   grow with intellectually and emotionally. Who wants to love and be loved. If she is compassionate and graceful then I guess She could be the one.

"This must be one of the most difficult things I have tried to do. I am attempting to describe in this space a work in progress. ThatAA?A?s how I see myself. 

I believe that things happen for a reason and the people you meet in life are people you are meant to meet at that point of your life. I have dreams and ambitions but IAA?A?ll leave those for later. 

I like my work- on good days I feel like a fraud for taking money to do a job that gives me so much pleasure. But this is on good days, on bad days- m not paid enough to put up with the nonsense I have to deal with! 

I am not a party animal. When I go out I prefer to spend time with people I know well. We could do anything from just staying home, watching a movie, to dancing the night away (been a while since I did that- but I can still remember it!), or experimenting with food. I like eating different cuisines. 

I have been told that I have an off beat sense of humour. ItAA?A?s kind of weird, sarcastic and sometimes downright dark. It takes getting used to. 

I cherish my family and friends. I feel blessed and honoured to have them in my life. 

Stuff I like
Music: Santana, Elvis, Kenny Rogers, , Dinsey Movie Tunes, UB40, music with Soul and music I can sing along with.... 
 have to mention I like reading comic strips my favourite-Calvin &amp; Hobbes

I love to travel. I have to plan my holidays - lots of places I want to experience; like the Himalayas Hemkund sahab in Himachal, Kashmir, Amazon rain forests, Peru, Venice, Milan, Egypt, Ladak, the small South-East Asian countries where I can backpack, live like a local and just beAA?A.. Work gets in the way!!

I relax by hanging out with friends. I can discuss anything on this earth but discussions should not turn into a argument just for the sake of winning. 
What I am looking for in my soulmate-..... Honesty above all. She must love to cook (need not be edible) so that I can learn from her, know how to have fun, be able to sit still at peace with herself say everything and nothing in silence. A romantic streak would be helpful and appreciated! Must have a wacky sense of humour. Someone who is ready to except her mistakes gracefully AA?A
I want my soul to know that bond of sharing a peaceful space with another person.","What I am looking for in my soul mate: Honesty above all.

"I would describe myself as a person who fits in more humane personality; a person who also cares for the people around, loving, gentle and affectionate. Flexible to mold myself for a caring and loving partner with whom I want to create an exceptional level of friendship, values of life, trust, and care which I have seen missing in lots of relationships. In short I am looking for someone who also thinks, cares and believes in selflessness in this selfish world. 
Besides, I am outgoing, fun, jovial, sporting and a good company. Socializing, travelling watching good movies, etc etc are few things I do after whatever time my work and household chores allow me to. I try to achieve a mix of east and west, practising and balancing my religious duties the best I can. Being brought up in an intellectual family background has helped me to look at things in a better perspective of sense, logic, justness and fairness of life.

"Thanks for dropping by... I am trying this first time so excuse if it doesn't sound interesting to you.
I am working as a director in a MNC. Earning very decent amount. Have traveled a lot (US, Europe, APAC). We spent about 9 years in US and then decided to settle back in India. We are financially secure and in a very comfortable position. I have 2 lovely kids (12 &amp; 7) Son and daughter. Wife died in a road accident 8 months back. I am single parenting my kids and looking for a suitable match, who is very smart, educated, intelligent and can share and shower her love to all of us.  I guess I am not asking much.
On the lighter side- I am a very fun loving person and want to enjoy life at its fullest. Have good sense of humor and love to dine, party and adventure. I have an athletic body and I love sports and try when ever find time from Home and office :). Last but not the least...I have become a good cook now and can cook many Indian and continental dishes. So people say let me buy dinner for you...I would say I am okay either way - buy or make :). I love comedy/adventure and action movies. I do not like to sit at home on weekends unless we are cooking something special.
If you find this interesting.....do drop a note   and thank you for reading this so far ...appreciate your patience","I am looking for educated,smart, intelligent girl who can become mother to my two lovely little kids (12&amp; 7) Daughter is 7 years and she really wants a mother who can be her friend and guide.

I would prefer as partner,friend and wife who take things as it comes and also wants to lead the live to fullest extent. No one is perfect, so as long as there is understanding, I think we can achieve everything we can. I do not want to write too much on what an idela partner should be.....but its just simple--------

"My simplicity and decency describes me and my nature well. Due to my simple nature I have acquired a lot of good things and people around me. 
In my professional life I like being serious and do my work with full commitment. Presently I am working as an accountant in a well known organization. Like everyone I also want to grow in my profession and make my parents feel proud of me. 
One of my major weaknesses is that I am very sensitive.
My mother is a homemaker and father has taken retirement from his profession. My brother is engrossed in the diamond business and doing well. I also have a lovable sister who is married and well settled in her life. 
In my higher education sector I have completed B Com from Gujarat University. 
I dona??t like to share my feelings with many people and like to be reserved when it comes to making friends. Though I have few friends in my life but they are the best part of my life. 
Music is an art of living a peaceful life and avoiding the major complexities and problems of life. Therefore, I like listening to music and also watching movies. Another hobby of mine is travelling to new places.","The girl to whom I will get married to should be well qualified and settled in her life. I want her to be simple and soft spoken so that both of us can lead a happy and stress free life ahead. My preference will be given to a girl from Gujarat posing a good family background. 
She should be flexible enough to fit in my family and once she will enter my family, then she will receive lot of love from them. My family would happily accept her and will not change her as per their thinking.
Only thing I expect from my wife is to respect my parents and other family members. In return her family will also receive complete respect and love from my side. 
I will always be there to assist my wife with the tasks at home and outside home. If she is like the one I am looking for then I assure her a happy future ahead.

Never forget to tell the one you love that you love them,
you will never know what happen tomorrow might be
to late.
		
I never really knew you
You were just another friend
But when I got to know you,
I let my heart unbend.
I couldn't help past memories
that would only make me cry
I had to forget my first love
and give love another try
So I've fallen in love with you
and I'll never let you go
I love you more than anyone
I just had to let you know
And if you ever wonder why
I don't know what I'll say
But I'll never stop loving you
each and every day
My feelings for you will never change
