"Hi, I am a telecom professional, presently working as a senior manager in strategy &amp; planning for a top-tier telecom MNC at Mumbai, India. I've had my schooling from prestigious schools in New Delhi, followed by B.E (Comp. Sc. Engg. ) with Distinction from Pune University. I'm pretty ambitious,and a solid go-getter, but since I like having my cake and eating it too, I try and maintain that elusive work-life balance. I grew up in Delhi, and have also lived extensively in Pune and Bangalore, before zeroing in on the wonderful, enterprising, chaotic, melting-pot of a metropolis that is Mumbai. I'm passionate about travel, literature, music, the feminist/humanist cause, yoga and nature. I'm a history buff, a feminist and a classical music enthusiast. I like theater, old films, world cinema and while I love my own company too, I suppose I could be called an extrovert as I also like meeting and engaging with like-minded passionate people. I also love exploring different cultures and places around the world and in India.. a sort of female Indiana Jones, if you will. I'm looking for a suitable, intellectual, well-educated, cultured person from a similar family upbringing, background &amp; position. Looking for adventurous souls who are liberal, feminist, spiritual, devoid of ANY gender bias, and are blessed with a great sense of humor. Vegetarianism and being a non-smoker are key preferences.","We are looking for a suitable, well-educated, cultured person from a similar family upbringing, background &amp; position. 
A well-traveled person brought up with liberal ideas and thoughts, a strong sense of ethics, a spirit of kindness and an interest in giving back to society, with an ability to relate to people well. A great sense of humor, varied interests and hobbies, a keen interest in different cultures &amp; places, a broad-minded, independent, non-chauvinistic nature, and a cheerful disposition rounds off the ""list"". I usually get along best with creative, spiritual, intellectual, passionate, driven people, ideally interested in classical music, old temples, theater, art and good literature (that's how I spend most of my free time, hence I'd prefer someone whose interests match mine, else there wouldn't be any ""us"" time at all). Oh, and those who've grown up devouring the adventures of Bertram Wooster, Captain Haddock and folks from a certain Gaulish village usually end up being kindred spirits. Finally, vegetarianism, being a non-smoker, and being a feminist/devoid of all gender-bias, are must-haves. ","We come from a very well-placed, highly-educated family of senior-management PSU executives, and senior bureaucrats (IAS /IES) in the central government at New Delhi. My dad - an engineer from IIT-Madras, retired as a senior executive from a central PSU, New Delhi. Mom -a very well-known exponent of Indian classical music (the veena). My parents are currently based in Bangalore post retirement. My grandfather was a PadmaShree awardee, and a key adviser &amp; Constitutional expert in the Central Govt. My sister - a Sr. Management professional at a leading software MNC in Mumbai, and bro-in-law, the MD &amp; Head of Research(investment banking) at a global banking conglomerate.

"I wonder how a person can be described in just a few words. A human being is such a complex personality that unless you spend some time or live with that person, it is difficult to understand him or her. However, I will try to be as honest as I can be. 
Unlike other profiles, my daughter don?t claim to be a beautiful, charming or a good-looking girl as she strongly believe that what is attractive to one, may not be the same for another. And then, don?t forget, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder.

Now talking about her interests, she is a voracious reader and writing is a passion for her.  It is the way she express herself. She is  quite obsessed with Queen?s English and proof of it is that hardly a day passes  her without  consulting a dictionary five-10 times.

Photography also interests  and she did a short course but unfortunately could not pursue it further. Most of her time  spent in reading, writing and consulting a dictionary, whatever time is left is divided among  family and a very few precious friends.

She also like spending time and interacting with the aged as she strongly believe that they are storehouses of knowledge. She is much concerned about aged people and look after them very well. She is very discipline and punctual. She  like watching good cinema and travelling to new places. At times, she don?t even mind watching soap serials.
Now, if this description intrest  in you, I can arrange meeting or chat with her.",,"Ours is a very small family of self, wife and daughter.

"Well, describing me in a few words is impossible however this word, impossible, in itself says I'M-POSSIBLE. So lemme try dis out. 

I, after a LOT of cajoling(from parent/family) have agreed to visit a few matrimonial sites, looking for my Mr. Right.  I have a pleasing personality with a very fair complexion. I am heavy in body type and working out these days to tone down my body as my bro, whose Maj with Indian Army has made me realise the hazards of being over weight. 

I simply LOVE food and am a GOOD cook too(but not too keen to enter the kitchen). I love pets especially dogs, have 2 as of now.

One drawback in me is that am drop dead emotional, one who would cry if any animal dies in a movie or when guy gets the girl at the end of all the turmoil in Bollywood movies. 

I am excellent in my communication skills(kudos to my groomin for the BPO industry). I have had International exposure during my tenure in the BPOs wherein my profile made me interact with US cliental on hourly/daily basis. Am very confident of my attributes.
 
My family consists of my dad who is a retired business man(fond of yoga/alternative therapies), mumma who is an HOD(music &amp; dance), eldest bro who is a Defence Employee, sis-in-law who works wid special children, elder bro who owns the business of marketing Solar Solutions.

That's about  me. Lemme see my LUCK here........","Okay, here I go describing my Mr. Right...... He should be wearing a shining armour, riding on a black horse and should be carrying a shiny sword........ HAHAHAHAHA. NO NO NO

That is not wht am looking for in my future partner. I am CRAZZZYYY about Indian Army. So, I would prefer my partner to be from the same profession. If not here are some traits which should be present in you to be my MAN:
# he should atleast have moderate values, if not liberal.
# he should have ability to make people laugh or smile
# he should be someone I love talking with as when we grow old that is one thing which would be required the most
# he should be someone I can be friends with rather than being a lover or a wife. 
# he doesnt have to be a drop dead handsome as they dont make good husbands(kidding). Seriously, am looking for someone who would just look good with me not someone who is every women's dream man
# he should have respect for elders and love for young ones
# he should be able to cook to stay alive for himself

In short, you have to be someone I can be myself rather than portraying to be someone esle.......

I love adventure sports, watching movies, listening to music, going on long drive (passionate about Bikes) and sometimes painting too. I hate people who lie to me, I prefer people telling me where I am going wrong rather than a third person come an tell me. I would definitely wish to have some basic qualities that everyone desires but maybe my expectations for a partner are not very Different or might be the Same as yours.","I would definitely wish to have basic qualities that everyone desires but maybe my expectations for a partner are not very Different or might be the Same as yours.

"I want to request all to plzz read my entire profile before contacting or sending any request 

I am a simple girl with a mix of Indian &amp; Western Values. i like honest and sober people. i believe in GOD though i am not too religious but i follow certain rituals since childhood in my routine n follow them, but yes i am spiritually inclined, like to make people laugh and love to be happy as and when i can. 

I believe in changing with times but not at the cost of family and our values. I believe in giving respect to all as I feel if u give respect, u will definitely get it back (Life is too short to hold grudges). 

I am working as CAO and pursuing C. A. Final Year. I like reading Books.. any good stuff (other than sports).... like reading Newspapers, like music.. sober n instrumental... like to do many things... painting, cooking, embroidery, travelling, watching good comedy n romantic movies... Yes, sometimes i am a bit short tempered towards insane behaviour with needy and helpless people. 

I am doing a little bit from my side for social causes. Presently, working for awareness of diabetes and control through propagation of yoga and proper diet. 

i want to go to a family where elders have importance... they r respected n given their due place for being parents and bringing us up with hardships.... so i want to be in a family where parents r there as a shadow...","My expectations are... a simple person, understanding, sober, caring, human in behaviour, should respect elders and care youngers... should accept me and my beliefs the way i am.. should know the meaning of commitment and should b a friend then my soulmate.. should be my biggest support system on whom i can rely completely and vice versa.. He should believe in living every moment of life. He should belong to the old school of marriage i. e. should believe in spending 40-50 years with one single person... i believe in inner soul... i believe a relationship should be such that a smile should be enough to erase all fights between a couple...

"Helping others is the best feeling for many people. It gives them satisfaction and pleasure, and I am one of those people who feels immensely happy when she helps others. Doing anything for them, if I can, gives me a wonderful feeling. 
That was why I chose the profession of teaching. I love my work and spending time with my students and teaching them is one of the best things I do in a day. I would like to grow in my profession. However, I can leave my profession if my future family expects me to. I am not very career oriented and this will not be a problem for me. 
I get emotionally attached with people quickly which is not very good for me. Though some people return the same feeling, but many end up hurting me. Apart from that, I am very homely and can manage household work efficiently. 
My father is a Senior Technician in IOCL. My mother is a homemaker and all my siblings are happily married. 
Education wise also, I am quite qualified. I have done B.COM, M.COM, NTT and B.ED. All these degrees have not only made me professionally sound, but have also made me confident. 
I am traditional but I donAA?A?t mind modernity, if itAA?A?s healthy. This according to me is a very good quality to possess. 
When I am free, I cook and serve people. They like my cooking and even if they do not, I am quite open to suggestions. I like listening to music as it refreshes my mind.","I want my partner to be very good and be decent by nature. This will help us in bonding with each other. I am sure if he is like that, he will seek a lot of respect from me. Apart from that, I want him to be a non-smoker and a non-drinker. This is because I donAA?A?t want him to have any bad habits which will create a nuisance in a family. 
I donAA?A?t mind him being from any profession. All I desire for is a well-settled man with a good job. His family should be very good and they should accept me as I am. This will not only make them like me, but also make me very comfortable. 
As I mentioned above I am not career oriented and will not mind if my future family wants me to leave my job. However, they should not try to dominate me, as I will not take that. 
My family is well reputed in the society and we all are proud of it. I expect the same from my future family. They should have a good background, as my parents will prefer that. 
I am very traditional as a person but I donAA?A?t mind modernity if it is for good. I have accepted many modern values and I am ready to accept the same in future as well. 
Apart from all I need from him is his support so that we can spend the rest of our lives happily.",,34 to 41,05 Oct 1979,08:25:00,India,Faridabad,,,,Brahmin - Saryuparin,,,,,,Daughter,M.Com. (Commerce),"34 yrs, 5ft 5in,<br />

"I describe myself as a simple and soft spoken person who is friendly in nature. I have deep faith in god as he always guides me to the correct path in life. 
Presently I am not working anywhere but in I would like to see myself working in a good organization at a reputed position. Further, I do a lot of hard work to attain the top position in life. My main weakness is that I am very emotional and sometimes people take advantage of my emotional nature. The ones who are close to me never make fun of me or take advantage. Rather they always try to make me strong in order to face this world with confidence. 
My mother is a homemaker and father is a business man. I have two brothers, one of them is married and both of them are engrossed in business.
After completing my school education I did B Com from Delhi University and MCM from Bharati Vidyapeeth, Pune, and MBA through Correspondence.
There are very few friends in my life and I like to spend most of my time with them only. They are always there to support me and always encourage me in life to achieve the best. In my free time I like listening music and watching movies with my friends. I also like to plan outings and go to new places.","I want to marry a man according to my choices. He should be an understanding person. He must understand me and my aspirations in life. He should be a simple person with a fun loving nature. This way both of us will get to know each other well. 
My life partner should be a well educated person with a positive outlook towards life. He must look at life broadly. His family should have a good image in the society as it will be the major area of concern for my family as well, as they want me to get settled in a well mannered family.
 I have no choices regarding the profession of my husband; I just want him to be well settled. Personally I would prefer a man form Delhi, Gurgaon. He must respect his elders and should realize their importance in our life. If he is like the one I am looking for then I am ready to spend my entire life with him.

I know the importance of cultural and traditional values in life and take utmost care about them. 
In my professional life I am working as a Teacher and I am very sincere about my work. I do it with full loyalty and devotion. Like everyone I also want to grow in my field and attain expertise in my teaching domain. My ambitious nature has brought me immense success at each level of life. 
My mother is a homemaker and father has taken retirement from his profession, earlier he was working with Railway. I have three brothers, first one is working as a Mechanical Engineer with National India Limited, the other one is working as an IT officer in a Central Bank and the last one is currently preparing for IAS exams. 
After my school education, I completed my MBA from Symbiosis, B Ed from IEPM, Ghaziabad, B Sc from MMH, Ghaziabad, M Phil from CCS University, Meerut and currently Pursuing MA (Education) from CCS University, Meerut.
Life is incomplete without friends as they are the best part of our life. I have very few friends and I like to be with them. Whenever I am free, I like to listen to music and watch movies. Further I also like to travel to new places and explore new things about every place. In addition to this, I also like surfing on the internet.","Marriage is a spiritual journey requiring two complete individuals to be faithful towards each other. Marriage requires deep understanding and transparency. And this is what I expect from my partner, to understand me because there are moments in life which are crucial and at that point of time your understanding helps you to overcome the bad phase in your life.   
He should be well educated and must come from a good family background. I dona??t mind marrying a person from any profession as ita??s completely his choice. I want him to be well settled so that we dona??t struggle after marriage for the basic necessities of life. This will also be a major concern for my parenta??s as well.
He should be simple like me; this will help both of us to develop a good bond and understanding with each other. Further, I dona??t want him to be simple just in thoughts but also from inside and must value the natural way of conveying things. He should also believe in faithfulness in a relationship as transparency in a relation makes it strong and long lasting.

"Basically I&#8217;m a very simple kind of person , having good height, good physic and long black hairs.

I have been told by friends that I am a kind hearted, outgoing, caring person. Of course this is for you to decide when we speak. I enjoy the usual activities like everyone, such as  reading, movies, music, camping, hanging out with friends and family. I believe the company is more important than the activity. I try just about everything once. Mainly  because I don't want to miss out on anything. I am looking for that someone special to complete my life. In a relationship, honesty, trust, caring, open mindedness, humor and respect are important. This is what I would like my soul mate to possess. I do not believe one should ask for anything they cannot return. If I seem like someone you can get along with then I'd love to hear from you. My ideal soul mate would have a fantastic sense of humour who could make me laugh all of the time. Someone who does not play head games is straight-forward, enjoys trying new things and places and is fairly romantic.
: I'm not perfect so I don't expect someone else to be either.
Someone with an honest heart. Knows what they want and how to get it. One who knows how to treat a heartiest soul mate.
