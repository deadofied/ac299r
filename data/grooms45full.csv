I have respect for those people who respect elders and give importance to them. Therefore, my life partner must give respect to my family and the elderly people and in return I would also respect her family.

 I am a very emotional person and I want my wife to know about it. She should understand this fact and make me strong. Everyone likes to be adored and if she is the way I want her to be then I would give her all my love and would make her happy.

"I come from a decent, reasonably well-to-do, upper middle-class family. We are a compact family - only me and my parents - no siblings. Both myself and my parents are modern in our outlook, but at the same time we value our traditions and customs, since we believe that these traditions and customs are the ones which bring discipline in one's life and teach us to value everything that God gives us.
My first marriage was an unfortunate and bitter experience. We got divorced on mutual understanding after 11 years of separation; more about it later. 
I feel that one can emerge from any situation in life given the right attitude, patience, dedication and utmost faith in the Almighty.
Whatever I am today, financially, is entirely on my own, without any help from anybody. I am a self-made man and take pride in saying this to anybody. I am both an introvert and extrovert, serious and humorous, hard-working and playful, as the situation demands. Having Libra as my moon sign, striking a balance between extremities comes to me naturally.
My favourite pastime is watching a good movie/ drama, solving puzzles, reading or, simply spending some quality time with the family either indoors or outdoors. I am passionate about music - it doesnt matter which kind. The only criteria is that it should be soothing to the mind. I like playing cricket, tennis, badminton and chess. Being one with nature, with lush greenery and waterfall, or a calm sea-front, is my idea of a perfect getaway.","Mutual-respect, understanding, caring, empathy, supporting, giving each other his/her space, honesty, giving importance to family, and above all, commitment, is what I look forward to in marriage.

I believe that first my partner should be mentally prepared for marriage, she can take her time in fully knowing about her life partner, only then she should agree for marriage. After marriage she should accept her in laws to be her own family members and not treat them as outsiders or aliens, now a days this has become a trend for newly married brides not to care for her in laws, she knows only her husband. This is not acceptable      at all. She should be expert in the household matters and be capable of looking into the education of the children. She will have to adjust with everybody as everybody would adjust with her. Her parents should not interfere or poke into her maried life once she is married. Nothing more is required for becoming an ideal wife.

"My philosophy for life is quite simple. I get up in the morning with a smile and go to sleep with a yawn. In between, I occupy myself as best as I can. Fill what's empty. Empty what's full. Scratch where it itches. Smile at all. Share what I have. Crack jokes to laugh. Make others happy. Spread love amongst all. And that's life what I call.
I am well organized, sincere, hard-working, polite, kind &amp; affectionate, passionate &amp; romantic, have good sense of humor, understanding and a good listener too. Love music &amp; movies, painting, arts &amp; crafts, decorating, photography, gardening, grilling &amp; cooking.
Love making new friends, get-together with family, relatives and friends, travelling distance places, exploring beaches &amp; nature, adventuring mountains &amp; forests.
Expect to live life to the fullest, enjoy an adequate happy enthusiastic life with my family, be a good husband and father, and expect my beloved to be simple, honest, faithful and straight forward and always smiling.
Seeking for my better half as she is out there, somewhere on this planet, know &amp; understand her better, share with her, marry and love her with all my heart, be honest &amp; faithful. Understand and respect her and live happily for the rest of my life.","According to me marriage is the union of two hearts to form one soul.

"I am a caring person looking for someone who has a good head on her shoulders. She should be compassionate and yet be able to manage the finances in the interest of the family. In financial matters, I follow the principles of financial guideline put forth by Suze Orman. 

On religious note, although I am a converted muslim, I respect all religions and have friends that cut across religions. 

While growing up in India and watching my parents devote their life to raise us, I learnt a valuable lesson of life - that children are our future. They need nurturing, time, effort and caring for their upbringing to be successful. I try to follow these basics with my own child and his friends. No wonder some of his friends have declared me the coolest dad who likes to play with and motivate them. 

To know more about myself and my expectations of my spouse, I decided to put perfectmatch. com to test for their profile analysis. Here is the gist of my profile analysis by perfectmatch. 

""I am cautious at the beginnings of relationships not to fall in love too fast. However, my optimistic nature looks to the possible rather than to the difficulties that may lie ahead. I am likely to put my love at the center of my life and I need someone who wants to be there. I take time for love and I need someone with the same priority. However, I do like varied experiences, so my life needs growth, change and perhaps, adventure. Boredom and habit are a part of all long-term relationships. I need someone who, like myself, will need to keep life (and the relationship) stimulating and new. I am the universal connector. I get along with just about everyone, except perhaps a serious Introvert. I am flexible enough to meet the challenge! In any case, I have the tools to be a great partner: I am not insecure in relationships, I like to work with someone on creating a life together, I don't get upset easily and seek intimacy and open up my heart to a partner. ""

I grew up in India in an educated Hindu household where education was the religion of our daily life. After attending AMU, I converted to Islam and came to USA for my graduate work. I am blessed with a ten years old son who lives with me. My son has been my source of inspiration for the odds that he has overcome to become what he is now. Most of my family lives in Northern India. My family includes: a) a sister who is married and lives in New Delhi b) a single brother who works for a Financial company and my parents. My father is retired now and my mother is a homemaker. All of my family is very open-minded and respects people for their belief and tries to seek good in each one of us.","To know more about myself and my expectations of my spouse, I decided to put perfectmatch. com to test for their profile analysis.

"I am journalist in India's most respected English newspaper, in Delhi. My interests in journalism is in international relations, strategic matters, etc.. 
Intellectually inclined, I am very much into reading, having over 1,000 books on various non-fiction subjects. My book on real reasons of war in Iraq and Afghanistan is nearing completion. 
I think I am a calm, simple, hassle-free, practical and down-to-earth person. I am attracted towards personalities having solidity and substance. 
I am interested in heritage, culture, art films, experiencing nature/environment and giving taste to all cuisines and if time permits, going for jogging. 
My parents being very feminist, I and my brother have been inculcated very pro-feminist attitude. 
I like to befriend those having solidity and substance in their personality. I also admire those who are practical and have immense common-sense.
Have experienced the world more than a person of my age normally does, which has made me look older and be more matured than my age. 
I invite you to see me through your eyes, to let me know myself better, which will also help me in putting my profile in a more correct perspective. 
In his condolence message on death of JaipurAA?A?s last official maharaja, Queen ElizabethAA?A?s II husband Prince Philip, after describing the maharaja, stated, AA?A?I think this is a prejudiced view. But then being pally is prejudiceAA?A?. In spite of being absolutely honest in describing myself, whether you are okay with my (prejudiced?) description or not, as the QueenAA?A?s hubby was with his, depends on whether we are going to be more than friends, or remain strangers. The ball is in your court, maAA?A?am, and IAA?A?m waiting for your serve.","I want my life partner to be good by qualities of heart and head. Even if not very educated, she should have educated mindset. 
I believe in spouse being equal in all aspects of married life, sharing all responsibilities, be in household or otherwise. I respect a lady who's an amiable combo of the Occidental and the Oriental. 
How about the person who would partner my life have the qualities which I don't have, thus supplementing and complementing my personality? But similarities in basics should be there. 
Would you disagree if I want her to walk our life besides me, not behind me or ahead of me? I'll dislike if she doesn't freely expresses all her thoughts, emotions, etc. to me. 
From theory to practical - if this asking-for-too-much list is a mismatch, just getting along, will make the days of our lives. 
Are you the one, who with me, will become the two-together, through thick and thin, till death does us apart? If not, then don't keep someone more deserving than me, waiting.",,20 to 45,26 Mar 1968,11:03:00,India,Lucknow,Average,,,Rajput,Rajput,,,Whetish Medium ,,Self,B.A. (Arts),"45 yrs, 5ft 8in,<br />

"Frankly, I don't have a handsome income and I depend a lot upon my mother. My mother owns a nice flat at a Calcutta suburb where I live with her. Well, I'm an E.D.P. trainer and I'm experienced in legal matters / drafting, official liaisons / correspondences, business affairs, etc. Did my B.A. ( Honours ) from Calcutta University and then M.A.(English) from Rabindra Bharati University, Calcutta. Well, I've also done a certificate course in Marketing Management. Besides, I individually participated in several talk shows of All India Radio ( 'Akashvani' &amp; 'Yuvavani' ), reciting my self-composed poems as well as performed at several prestigious cultural programmes sharing stages with celebrities &amp; prominent intellectuals. Please note that I may also relocate to the bride's place if required but I'll be visiting my mother as frequently as possible, say once a month or at least every year. My mother is a retired govt. officer and enjoys regular govt. pensions. My father was also a govt. officer who left us long before. Well, I LOOK EXCEPTIONALLY YOUNGER .. much, much younger than my age and I really never feel my age.... yes, I'm very fit as well. I'll soon post my recent photographs and you'll get to know how I really look like. Of course, I look much better in reality than my pics. Well, on the whole I'm tall,attractive, if not handsome,younger-looking or decent-looking &amp; jovial with athletic physique. My strong &amp; beautifully shaped shoulders, arms &amp; chest are no less attractive than any model.","Age, marital status, caste

Most importantly, she should not be an egoist or a dictator.","Residence is  at a Calcutta suburb, owned by mother, and office at Central Calcutta, owned by brother. Respectable middle class family.

"Sensitive and well-bred due to very loving and caring parents;who despite being highly educated and being ambitious, thought of their two sons more than anything else. I expect also to be a parent like them. As we are extremely well-off, dowry is a taboo, and considered an insult. Thus my life partner should be decent, well educated woman of empathetic and aesthetic nature. I wish to remain in All India Radio as Producer, but I shall continue my forays in to Bollywood, as training from FTII never goes to any waste. I wish to be a greater writer than my father, that shall be my way of paying respect to my folks. 
Incidentally I always wanted to be a pilot, doctor, broadcaster&writer; in that order while growing up!My parents did not let me join Naval Avionics!I myself left Maulana Azad Medical College, Delhi after one boring year!After graduation, I taught English Literature for a while and sat for my exams for All India Radio, got in and joined as a producer at an enviable(yet I always felt at an immature)age of 22. But something lacked in life, it kind of hit you while driving to FM transmission early in morning or driving back home at midnight!Since I was 5 or6 years of age, I had been mesmerised by my dad bent on his desk, writing!
I decided to go for film writing instead of literature and yet whether it was an indirect or direct wish, this was something which dawned upon me when I was 36. In order to fulfill that desire;I decided to sit for FTII's Screenplay course as a student, after putting in 13 years in All India Radio, Delhi as Programme Executive(PEX)/Producer. All India Radio, Delhi is one of the most action filled places one can wish for, as is broadcast journalism/programming, but I felt stiffled as I was considered an expert in non-fiction programmes on AIR FM and other channels. It was this that impelled me to again become a student at rather an advanced age, but liked and encouraged by my younger batchmates I topped the course &amp; was sent on deputation to FTII(The Film &Television; Institute of India, Pune)from AIR, Delhi as Associate professor&Officer; on Special Duty to director of FTII. 
My life partner must like literature, art, music, movies and have a distinct identity &amp; personality of her own. I hope to be a partner in her growth as an individual, and off course some one you will spend your rest of the life with. 
The most important thing that I've learnt watching my parents is committment. My mother was my father's strongest ally, critic and counselor all rolled into one, while he served as First Secretary(Education&Culture;)in Indian Highcommissions in Trinidad&Tobago; and later in Mauritius. Now that she's afflicted with immobility due to two strokes occurring simultaneously in 2001, my father tends to her all by himself, refusing to hire any personal nurse. 
Money is something that nobody in our family is unduly worried about, as both ancestral as well as self accquired is what would qualify us as extremely well off. However money is something you spend to live and not something you live for-I would expect my future partner to understand that.","slim,pretty and of a pleasant disposition.must be from a good family background.She will not have to worry about in-lawsproblem nor dowry.","My father, Dr. Hargulal Gupta, is a well known Indologist, novelist, critic, former diplomat and retired professor of Hindi;who taught for 43 years in D.
