Comunication- You need to be able to talk to your partner and trust that they will take into consideration you thoughts and opinions. If your relationship lacks this one simple quality, then you may as well be kissing a brick wall.

Comprimise- Both partners need to be able to give a little. One reason I believe alot of relationships fail is because one or both partners are selfish and want things their way.

Common goals- It is important to discuss with you partner things such as plans for your life, and wether or not you want children. 

Loyalty- It is VERY important to find someone who believes in commitment and will be loyal to you in marrige or in any relationship.

Love- There is a difference between Infatuation and Love. Dont let your heart get in the way of your mind and reason. Give it time to mature and dont hgo making any long term commitments until your sure that what your feeling is real.Be sure that you partner is will to do the same.


Humor- I love to laugh, and I love people who make me laugh.

There also has to be respect, consideration, and an ear or two to listen with.","Strength of character,confident,Honesty &amp;  integrity. Trust faith, sense of humor.
...a person that is attractive inside and out. 
 A joy for life..(most of the time), and goals that are close to mine, or that will blend with mine.

"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step but wouldnt the journey be more lovely with an even lovely partner. 

My Academic &amp; professional qualifications: B.S.C.(Biochemistry) 1st class 

Hobbies: dancing, music, surfing, traveling etc.

Personality: good looking very young looking active, smart, Recently I have had offers from the makers of various anti aging creams because I look nothing like a thirty-seven year... should look!! No doubt one day I shall wake up and find myself looking like an extremely old woman!! 

Myself: I consider myself intelligent, witty (at most opportunities), ""down to earth"", very honest, respectful of others, always upbeat and positive, and with a polished, professional and conservative appearance (please see photo). 

Some things about me... 

Likes: First of all Computer is my 1st luv. Being with good friends, meeting new people, keeping fit (that could be the reason I still look very young) seeing new places , trying new foods, challenges (career and personal), good Hindi movies and music, good Hindi-English music (no rap), being outdoors,Outings, reading books, and learning new skills. Aside from my interests in all things new, I equally appreciate the classics and respect tradition. 

Dislikes: early mornings, wishy-washy people, bad drivers, hot weather, traffic and dishonest people or those don't keep their word. 

A good match for me would enjoy items from the first list and share in my dislikes for items from the second list...plus my partner and I could add or take away new likes/dislikes from each list as we grow old together.","very sweet nature ,simple, good human being.",,30 to 42,13 Apr 1967,10:35:00,India,Mumbai,Average,,,Shewetamber,,,,Fair ,,Self,B.Sc (Science),"46 yrs, 5ft 4in,<br />

I look after the design and training function of an large corporate. 
I love listening to indian classical music and ofcourse the contemporary blends that musicians churn out nowadays. Am proud of our culture and our country.. . 

I am looking for a companion who is cultured, articulate, can express himself well (not to be confused with just good talkers), , belives in equality of sexes, open minded, very honest, happy and down-to-earth and is capable of loving and accepting someone else's child. This may not be easy but, well after what i have been through and what I am left with, I guess these have become standards for me. Looks are secondary. I, in return am willing to do the same, as in, would love to take on the upbringing of another person's child. No double standards for me. 

I could have thought of bringing up my child all on my own, but the thought of spending my old age all alone is not something I fancy. I would love to spend my life with a person and his famly I can respect and love. This may make me sound boring, drab and wishy washy. Well let me tell you, I am not that at all. I can have pillow fights with the one i choose, play tickling matches, go for long drives by the river (ahem.. if one exists in delhi), get wet in the rain, spend a cozy evening together watching a movie with wine and ofcourse one who is Mine!!
