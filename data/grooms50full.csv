"Very  spiritual , timeless  mind ,sans  frontiers (without boundaries) ,global citizen, live in real-time (the very moment), zero ego, unconditional  love for  all , and  hope  this makes  sense to you.

Sounds unreal AA?A??? fiction, strange, Its alright, not everyone expected  to  understand  it, there  are 6  bn  folks on planet earth  and have same number of perception about life based on their  experience  and  to the best  of their  ability .

Looking  for  one  special  who has  risen  above the myopic vision of life, understands &amp; realized that  life is just a short journey through  time &amp; space  of  planet  earth , and the  best way to utilize  this opportunity is to live in peace ,harmony,&amp;  happiness , live life  the best possible way we can in total  awareness &amp; mindful of  others  that their peace  is not disturbed. Am I a dreamer..? may be ? for me life itself  is a dream -
(as in dream nothing really happening  but  still seems  so real where all senses and emotions are active and responding  but when you wake up you realize  ,whoops  it was just a dream).

Is that  you ? I am looking  for, one who is in awaken  state  and  sees life in its true &amp;  absolute  form . carries  no baggage from past , are you naturally  blissful from  within , are you child  like yet wise &amp; mature as situation  demands . you fall in category  of soul mate. have no illusion  about yourself.  All I would say is, you are priceless.

I am not a preacher  of poverty neither  an advocate  for materialism ,believe  in middle path (what ever   comes  naturally without hurting anybody or self) the buzz words  are  content, happy, blissful, these are the  most  precious things in life.

I am on this site for no particular reason, just  inspired  by M.J. 
AA?A? you are not alone AA?A?, and scientific theory AA?A? are we alone in the universeAA?A? just  curious ,is there some one I can relate to who is think &amp; feel  alike, I would  like to share  rest of my life with you.

Like every one else chasing the rainbow or in search of Eldorado (city of gold), wish you all the best, may life unfolds for you in best possible way,  the  way  best suited  for you.

Blessed  be"," 
""being"", does not belong to any race ,creed belief,sect,geographic location ,any sort of pride , as these are nothing but temporary stage props to be with you till the show lasts . all you have to be is simple human being.

"This is the second time I've come to this page to write about myself. The first time I had no idea what to write. I then started asking people what I was like and got a lot of opinions. Most were similar, so I'll write them down. People say my main asset is my sense of humour (Ya, right. I'm sure you heard that before. This time it's true. ) and my happy attitude towards life. I feel life is to short to take seriously, but long enough to plan ahead for a future. I also believe money isn't the end all of life, I believe in God, in all things beautiful, people(I still think there's hope for humanity), my partner and most of all I believe in GOOD FOOD (I owned 2 American-Italian restaurants). I am a creature of my environment. I feel at home in the lap of luxury of a 5 star hotel or in a one room shack (provided its on a Goan beach: ) Just kiddin'). So in a nutshell I'm happy, easy going, chilled, peaceful, laid back yet ambition, hard working and goal oriented.

A little about my past: Born U.S., 4th std to Bsc Bangalore, back to U.S. for Engg, owned Greek American restaurant in U.S., sold business, moved to India 1993 to be with parents, married 1994, opened restaurant in chennai, divorced 1999, sold restaurants2008, have communications firm till date. This is the Readers Digest version. Full version available for perusal after sacrificing pinky finger.

Well, I guess I finally got through this. I hope I pass the test.

Looking for: Enough about me for now. Lets get to you. I obviously gel with people having traits similar to mine. But I think a partner should be different in ways as to keep the balance (something like yin &amp; yan). As for looks, if you think you're beautiful, not only on the outside but mainly on the inside, then you are (no cliche, I mean it. )",,"My Family: What can I say? My parents are conmen, my brother a hustler and my sister a jewel thief. Just pulling a fast one. It's been too long since I wrote or said something stupid. My parents and sibling are wonderful people, just like me (think I have an ego?). If it matters to you what they do, then here it is- my Dad is a father of 3, a retired director of a defense research establishment, mother housewife or should I say a 'stay at home mom' and a great cook, my brother a software professional (got to have at least one in the family) and a father of one and lastly my sister an accounting/software person and mother of 3. That's it. Hope you like them.

"It is really difficult to express about one's self. But I would like to brief in short.

I am friendly, sought after by my people to often manage different types of difficult crisis.

Basically I am a practical spiritualist coupled with a fine blend of modern scientific experiences. a successful holistic and psychic healing master and therapist, practicing the same over past 10 years.
i look young as 39 though i am 43. :-)

I started my life as businessman in the advertisement field with a zeal to win over the competitors. 

Since my entire effort was to learn, I could not think of getting married earlier. To say this is the only reason for my delayed effort in myself getting married.

But now I feel and believe that many years of social acquaintance and a large number of clientele has left in my mind a clear evaluation about a valuable company of a woman in the form of a better-half of a man.

I strongly believe, especially in the journey of man's or woman's life towards his true goal of attaining peace and joy while living in this earth is nourished only through the combined living of the both in a perfect understanding and especially in the magnanimous acceptance of the defeat of the ego to each other for the sake of love. Because losing the little self is life and it is the real expansion and growth.

I respect women for their patience and perseverance. I am honest. Responsible, and hardworking. I am living in a joint family(with mother). I am confident of building up and looking after my family under all circumstances.  thats me in a nutshell:-).","I expect the bride to be  adjustable and educated and cultured.

"Everyone experiences tough times, it is a measure of your determination and dedication how you deal with them and how you can come through them.
Life is no smooth road for any of us; but this is also true that any problem no matter how big it is can be solved through man itself. After facing lots of struggles, I am now well settled in my life as an Account Manager, and aiming for a higher position in a well-known organization. I will achieve it very soon as I am very ambitious. 
Working with a group of companies is one of my qualities. I can handle lots of work at same time and complete it with efficiency. 
I truly believe in spiritual beauty. It's a kind of radiance. People who possess a true inner beauty, their eyes are a little brighter and their skin is dewier. They vibrate at a different frequency. Appearance and beauty get dull by changing time but beauty of heart is evergreen and it lasts forever.
I am a decent guy, having a good personality and good behavior. Being a civilized person, I like Indian culture and customs.
 I have a close connection with my family. I have good and friendly relations with my two brothers and they have never let me feel the absence of a friend in my life. I feel understanding can bound anyone in healthy relations and I foresee same feelings in my life partner.","The recipe for beauty is to have less illusion and more soul. My belief is, beauty is what is inside you, and it reflects in your eyes. A girl with a beautiful heart and good nature will be my eligible to become my soul mate.
I will appreciate if she will possess good nature, cultural and family value in her. My girl must have respective nature toward elders, family and for me as well.
She must keep my family as connected as it is right now. She needs to have a very comforting nature, as this is what I demand the most.
I am very liberal as a person and she can choose whatever field she wants as her profession. I will respect whatever she does as long as she respects my work. 
I will admire her if she will hold her responsibilities sincerely. I will always support her in her professional life if she will work. My existence will help her in all responsibilities, either outside home or at home. I will show all my concern for her and for our kids too.
I am waiting for someone to share my love, to share my secrets, to see my future life with her and to share lots of happiness forever with her.

"I am born in Malaysia, educated in Australia and live in Singapore. My grandparents are from India.

I work for a large American MNC.

I am not perfect by any means, I am honest (sometimes a little direct!), hard working, and have done quite well form myself thru God's grace, hard work and a little luck.

I am well traveled, my work takes me around the Asia Pacific and the USA.

I am guided by my conscience and I am God fearing. I have traveled around India extensively, and really enjoy Indian food, music and culture.

I am concerned about the environment, and love wildlife sanctuaries and National Parks. I used to play lots of sport in my youth - badminton, squash, hockey, tennis. Nowadays I go for long brisk walks to get my required cardiovascular exercise.

I try and do good and give charity, as I believe good things happen to kind people. 

I love kids and sadly don't have any yet - willing to give myself another chance at happiness. 

I have a close knit family, my late father believed in spending lots of time with us and I hope to do the same if blessed with a good wife.

I respect elders, and am not ostentatious.

I believe in God, though I don't wear my religious convistions on my sleeve.

I love travel, the calming effects of North Indian classical music, and chilling out with good friends.

I'm fairly health conscious, and in fairly good health and exercise quite regularly.

I try to be happy. 

I wish you good luck in your search for happiness.","Looking for a soft spoken calm, kind hearted, cultured and educated lady, who wants to have kids of our own. If you already have kids, thats fine, I will do my best to love them as my own and provide well for them.
