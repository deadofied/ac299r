"We should all live our lives joyously, calmly, freely and sincerely. I am amongst those people who are calm and patient in life and donAA?A?t crib about things. My nature defines me as a jovial person who likes to enjoy life and keep others happy. I also have interest in crafts and arts and like to do something creative.
I have worked with NIIT Technologies for almost 2 years. I have a total experience of 9 years and from the past one year I am not working anywhere. 
Parents have a very eminent position in life and I deeply love them. They are my real models and greatest assets of life. My Mother has expired and father has taken retirement from his profession. Earlier he was working with Voltas Limited. He has worked there for almost 20 years. I have a brother who is currently working with an MNC as a Manager. 
After my school education, I completed my B Sc from Bombay University and then I did my PGD in Software from SNDT, Mumbai. 
My hobbies include reading books and crafts and arts. Whenever I get time from work, I like to be with my friends and to be with them means that I can freely express myself.","Every girl in this world always desires to marry a person of her choice. Therefore, I also want to marry a man of my choice. 
I want my husband to be simple and decent because a simple man is free from the complex problems of life. Further, he must understand the importance of a family and should give prominence to the family values. This way I will have no problems in adjusting with his family. 
I donAA?A?t mind marrying a man from any profession until and unless he is well settled. He should understand this point as it is very important for me as well as my family. If he is settled then in future we will not face problems like many couples face in terms of financial issues. 
My life partner should be well qualified so that he has a positive and a practical exposure towards life. I want my husband to belong to a good family background. Further, his family must be well behaved and should have a decent image in the society.

I believe that the Almighty God does not create any junk or defective pieces therefore I believe that I am a master piece in the hands of the Almighty God, created in the image and likeness of the Almighty God and I look exactly like my creator. Although I am a Physically challenged person with Polio for my left leg, Polio does not stop me from living life to the fullest. Polio has only drawn me closer to my God and thought me to depend on God totally for everything. With God's grace and strength I am able to do everything a normal person does, therefore with a smile I can say,"" I can do all things through Christ who Strengthens me ""Spiritually I am very strong and I do not believe in Compromising on Gods divine words.I do not believe in limiting my God and his promises for my life in any and every way.All I know is that he is the God of the Impossible as even the word ""Impossible"" says, I am Possible ""I like to do anything and everything constructive that would bless my life and the lives of those that I encounter and make me a better human being.Most of the time I Love to read the Bible and spend time Praying,I love to Cook,surf the net and explore new spiritual websites to gather new information and build up my spiritual life.I love to do anything and everything that will make me a good human being, there is nothing that I don't like doing, cause if I take a dislike for something then it becomes very difficult to take a liking for it.I can never say that I am unable to do something, as I know that with a little bit of help from family ,friends and even strangers I will reach my destination, achieve my goals and fulfill each and everything in my day to day life. All I need to do is be a little humble and ask for help. I got Polio at the age of 11 months, but God has healed me and is still healing me slowly but surely. I still await that day when my miracle will be fully completed, it could be today. I believe in living life one day at a time.","I am looking out for a loving, caring, God-fearing, Christ centered Catholic guy. Someone who does not drink or smoke and simple in every way.

"Life assimilates joy and sorrow AA?A?both!  Positive attitude and determination is the tool which a person can use to overcome the hurdles of life.  My vision for life is hidden in persistence and taking all challenges of life with a positive approach.
Family is number one priority of my life. I feel pride and joy in taking responsibilities of my family; I always consider providing love and support to my family as my first responsibility.  
My upbringing in a middle class nuclear family has taught me the importance of family values. I have great respect of family values-both customary and modern.  
I believe that beauty resides in simplicity and hence I have chosen to live my life through simple ways.
Marriage for me has huge significance.  The sacredness of seven vows is pious to me. I deem that wife and husband are friends, philosophers and guardians of each others.  Respect and mutual understandings for each other keeps them close at all times. I wish to have a husband, who shares same thoughts about his life partner as me.
I consider home as an important component of life.  I love to cook and my taste for food is as simple as my lifestyle!  Love for vegetarian dishes always drives me towards experimenting new kind of recipes. And this interest pushes me to utilize my leisure time in learning the art of food making. Whenever I get time after my household chores I love to read all sorts of books and watch knowledgeable programs on television.  These are the tools which I use to revitalizing myself. 
I share my thoughts and time with only loyal friends.","Politeness of a man gets attention and great admiration. I would love to be the life partner for a person who has great respect of woman and is able to share his quality time with family. I have high opinion for Indian culture and at the same time great acceptance of our rich heritage. A girl always anticipates her prospective life companion not only as her custodian but also a true friend. My would be husband should be able to understand my personal feeling and also respect my individual identity. I wish for a person of liberal thoughts to become my life partner. I will pour all love and respect and this surely will transmit constructive energy in my spouse. I perceive family as a necklace, where beads are threaded. I hope that my companion also has similar views as we have to walk hand in hand, in future. His non-smoking and non-drinking habits will be a major quality which I would love, as I consider both hazardous to health. Same way his simple eating habits will surely contribute me in aligning me with him in a more beautiful manner. To treat family in an efficient manner one must know his or her responsibilities clearly. Financial liabilities are the primary concern of the man in the family. I hope my prospective partner will have the wisdom to understand his priorities. To complete the needs of the family in all respects would be the responsibilities of both of us. I hope that someday at some fine moment a man of dignity, love and pride will hold my hand. He will stand beside me understanding our emotion and respecting my identity. Our respect, love, and submission for each other will make our married life prosperous and happy. I truly will pour all my love on him.",,38 to 45,19 May 1973,09:50:00,India,Kaithal,Slim,Doesn't Matter,,Arora,Punjabi,,,Very Fair ,Doesn't Matter,Sister,B.Ed (Education),"40 yrs, 5ft,<br />

"I represent myself as a calm and quiet person who likes to stay away from the complexities of life and live it in a simple way. I prefer to avoid getting into discussions or arguments as they lead to some serious conflicts. My polite nature has always been adored by everyone.  
In my professional life I am working as a Consultant with a reputed firm. My main objective in life is to be successful and attain that position where in I dona??t have to struggle for anything. I work hard every day to achieve my goals and targets. 
One thing that I want to share is that I am a very emotional person and get upset easily and take time to get normal. 
My mother is a house wife and father is an architect by profession. I have two sisters and one brother, out of which, one of my sisters is married and the other one is working as a Project Architect and my brother is presently working as a Consultant. 
After my schooling I completed MBA from XISS, Ranchi. 
I have very few friends with whom I share my feelings and spend time. Further, I like to sing and travel to new places. While travelling I click some of the beautiful scenes of nature.","The one who will enter my life should be simple and decent like me in nature and must have a positive way of living life. I have no preferences regarding his caste. Further, I have no objections related to my life partnera??s profession. I and my family want the person to be well settled as it will help in living a stress free life ahead in future. 
He should be well educated and must come from a good family background. This is very important for me as well as for my parents as they will be relieved to know that the family is well mannered. In addition to this, he should respect my family as it is very important for me.
He should understand my point of view towards life and must respect it. Further, I want him to have no objections if I continue to work after marriage.
I am ready to sacrifice my happiness if he the one I am looking for.

"I represent myself as a calm and quiet girl with a very simple way of living life. My simple nature has always helped me in avoiding the complexities and problems of life. Further, I am friendly and mingle with people very easily and can also adapt to any situation in life very easily. 
Presently I am working as a Teacher in a recognized school. I consider my work as a very responsible job where in I am accountable for many things. I have always taken my work seriously and have got many appreciations for taking up challenges and completing them efficiently. I want to grow up in my work and touch the pinnacle of success.
One of my negative points is that I am very emotional and cana??t hold on to things for a longer period. 
My mother is a homemaker and father is no more with us. He is and will always be remembered by us. Further, I have three sisters who are happily married and well settled in their life. 
In my school I was a good student and received a lot of appreciation. After completing my school education I did BA from Kalindi College. 
The list of my friends is very short as I dona??t like to socialize. I share my feelings and emotions with them and they understand me very well. Further, I spend most of my time listening to music, reading books watching television.","Like every other female even I want a man of my choice who is just like the one I have visualized in my mind and heart. 
My life partner should be simple and sober in life so that both of us complement each other and can further develop a bond. 
He can be from any profession as I have no issues regarding the work of my life partner. Me and my family want a well educated man to be my life partner as it will develop a good bond of understanding amongst us. 
He should be well settled in his life so that we dona??t really face any problems after marriage. This will also relieve my parents about my happiness and future security after marriage. Further, his family background should be good and decent. I would prefer a man from Delhi/NCR region.
