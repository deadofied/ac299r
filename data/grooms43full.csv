I do stay alone when I am sad but most of the times I love being around many people. I believe in sharing my happiness with everybody. I don't like people who lie.

The girl I wish to get married to must be very open minded and jovial. If she is light minded then I am sure we will have a wonderful life ahead.. 
I live in the real world and I am a very practical person. She can choose any career she wants to and if she is not around, I can take care of things as good as she does. I am good at maintaining relations and I am a very soft-spoken person. 
Other than being a wife, she should be a good friend of mine. If we become good friends, it will be easier for us to share what we have, we will get to know each other, and we can get along well. 
Personally, I love beaches and I find them very romantic. I am aware that it is very important for a girl that her partner is romantic and I will give her whatever she needs. Going on long drives is what I love the most and is very refreshing for me, and I am sure she will enjoy them too. 
She must respect my family the same way as I do and promise to return the same feeling back. She should be very adjusting and mould herself in my lifestyle. 
She must be very smart as this is one thing, which will be appreciated in my family as well.

"I am a very well-balanced individual. I am fun loving, easy going and rational person who is always open to new ideas and other people's opinions. I enjoy a lot of different things and lead a very active, adventurous and enterprising life. On a regular basis I play a variety of sports(golf, tennis, etc.) and take part in other outdoor activities like hiking, trekking, bycycling, etc. I also take regular self improvement and development classes, volunteer 2-3 times a week, and there is almost nothing that I won't try at least once.
 
I was born and raised in India and came to US in 1992 to do my Masters in Computer Science. My Dad was an officer in Air Force and so we lived all over India. I think this experience has made every member of my family very cosmopolitan and open-minded. This has also resulted in my Hindi being better than my mother tongue Kannada/Telugu. And since I have been living in US for more than 15 years now, I am the perfect embodiment of the cliche 'good blend of east and west' :-)
 
I love traveling and have traveled extensively all over India and US and am now planning on seeing rest of the world. I like cooking and am always trying new recipes. I also enjoy eating out and trying new restaurants and cuisines. I generally lead a very healthy life style - except for 1 evening a week :-). I workout in the gym about 4-5 times a week. I do have my crazy and wild side as well and have done Scuba diving, Sky diving, Bungee jumping, white water rafting, paragliding, parasailing, snorkeling, etc.

Although success in work and career are important to me, my personal life always comes first. I still strongly believe in the institution of marriage and am looking for someone who also has her priorities straight in life.

If I happen to contact you, please accept my interest only if you can provide your recent photos and are willing to talk directly with each other. I am not a big e-mail or chat person and also find that speaking with each other is more effective in getting to know one another (like they say, words make up only 30 of the conversation).

If any of this has piqued your curiosity and you want to be part of a fun-filled, exciting, and contented partnership, please drop me a line. 

Good luck with your search!","My ideal partner has to be easy-going, laid back, flexible, not short tempered and not stubborn. She should be open to new ideas and should be adventurous. ","Although my Dad is now retired, he still keeps himself busy with lots of different activities (including volunteering, small private ventures, etc. ) My Mom is a home maker and is a very calm, composed, gentle, soft spoken and understanding person. In my opinion she is the best Sasu a Bahu can ever ask for :-)

I have two sisters - one elder and one younger. Both of them are married and have wonderful kids and families. My Elder sister is a Surgeon and is married to a ENT Specialist. They live and practice in Mysore. My younger sister used to teach in a Medical College but is currently on a break doing her Doctorate. She just came back from Tanzania where she had gone to do some research work for her Ph. D degree.

"I have come into this life equipped with great curiosity, a lively, versatile, inquisitive mind, and an urge for constant learning and new experiences.  
My drive is to communicate, to make connections and association (between people or ideas), and to develop your gift for language and 
expressing yourself through the spoken or written word. Being an intermediary or messenger, a translator, a teacher, a broadcaster, 
a correspondent, or in some field where I can mix and mingle and interact with a broad spectrum of people, suits me well. Find out more when we meet

Fascinated by life's seemingly endless variety and the multitude of options and choices available to me, I have flit from one person, job, hobby, 
or location to the next, restlessly seeking new experiences and stimuli.  Even i do not do this in my outward behavior, inwardly my mind is 
in constant motion, and require a healthy dose of variation and mental or social stimulation in life in order to approach anything resembling 
contentment. Skimming lightly over the surface of life, however, can lead to a shallowness of understanding and a fluttering away of my energies.

"This is AMIT BALWANTRAI CHOUDHARY { Divorced after a very brief marriage of six months } I belive I am enterpresing, progressive, funloving &amp; a very practical person.
I am looking for a well educated girl who belives in family values. The institution of marrige &amp; has a modern out look towards life.
To spend a lifetime together there has to be a certain gentelness in her that should come up at all the right times. Money,looks &amp; sophistiction all count least.
She has to be smart carry himself well versed with the happening.
Its all about the compromise &amp; makeing sure we both do things that we enjoy together. 

she should be tall,average looks,well educated,understanding,supportive of my career and a very good humanbeing 

I'm AFFECTIONATE, AMBITIOUS, CONFIDENT, CARING, HONEST, PASSIONATE, REALISTIC, SENSITIVE, SUPPORTIVE, SELF-RELIANT, WORKOHOLIC and extremely OPTIMISTIC person filled with positive energy. 

I thinks that I?m stubble [at times], straight-forward [almost- always], a good listener [when with family &amp; friends].

I Respect and believes in FAMILY VALUES &amp; all TRADITION. I m a home bird, occasionally partying and eating out is O. K. I prefer to utilize my time with my family and to enhancing my hobbies, apart from my professional commitments. 

I would like to maintain a balance between my professional and family life. 
Moreover profession to me is not only the means to strengthen my financial status but a place to IMPROVE, LEARN and ENHANCE my-self. 

MARRIAGE TO ME-- is all about camanship, Sharing of EMOTIONS &amp; interest, Caring for EACH OTHER &amp; also FAMILY [in-laws, where not only two of us blend well, but the entire family does]. 
Marriage and family is the EPICENTRE and all other activities will orbit to ENRICH &amp; ENHANCE this special gift of union of two souls. Marriage also is a bonding between 2 families. 

To me MUTUAL RESPECT, FAITH, TRUST, HONESTY, GOOD COMMUNICATION &amp; UNCONDITIONAL LOVE are the vital ingredients for any healthy relationship and especially for THE INSTITUTION called MARRIAGE. 

COMPATIBILITY ought to be at INTELLECTUAL, EMOTIONAL and spiritual level with Full COMMITMENT from both along with full FREEDOM and SPACE TO GROW. 

I believe that marriage will help both of us achieve higher goals, which we would not gain as an INDIVIDUAL. 

The togetherness will be a pillar of strength for each other, a unique support system. MARRIAGE will also bring out the best in each other and both of us will grow as better individuals. 
I am here to meet that special some one, who will make my life beautiful and worth living every moment of it. 

Well I know what I am looking for. 

But at times I live life through the process of ELIMINATION i. e eliminating the unwanted things- and at the end I am automatically left with the desired thing/ product.

My Strong sense of intuitions - also help me to take the right decision at right time. 
I also believe that each one of us have a SOULMATE. 
For me life is a journey but final destination is finding my SOULMATE. 
MAYBE FATE HAS BROUGHT YOU HERE TOO.....

For me all religions are the same and lead to almighty. ItA?s just that each one professes it in a different way. My soul mate should respect my sentiments. For a relationship to be successful, it must be based on mutual understanding. Just as I donA?t expect my partner to blindly follow my faith, he too should give me the space to follow mine.",,,,01 Sep 1970,,India,,,,,Kayastha,,,,,,Self,M.Com.

"Hi. I am a friendly, fun loving, caring person who enjoys the company of my close friends and family. I love traveling, exploring new places, seeing art exhibits, theater and concerts. I am usually on the move and find it very hard to sit at one place for too long unless I am too tired, but this is something I am trying to work on. I work for one of the largest software firms in the bay area and manage a group of highly talented individuals who are responsible for training, consulting and special projects.This gives me an opportunity to travel around the world and at the same time provides me a dynamic work environment that is not boring and mundane. I try and go to the gym regularly and keep a healthy lifestyle but it gets tough to keep up the routine if I am traveling. I carry a calm, composed and steady head on my shoulders and very rarely lose my composure or temper. I like honest, kind, open, respectful and fun-loving people. I like people who are passionate and committed to the task at hand - be it personal or professional and respect people who mean what they say as I tend to take people on their word. I am always ready to try something new - whether it is an adventure, cuisine, music or arts.","My ideal partner would be someone who has shared but not necessarily exact interests and personality as me. She would be someone who loves traveland adventure, is social and capable of adjusting to different situations. She should be able to work  towards the common long term common goals as a unit. I would like her to be respectful to others at all times no matter the situation. She should be close to her family and be able to bond with mine.

I believe there are few who have the perfect chemistry where beauty is more of a mental match.Having each other in life should redefine the meaning of relationship. Likes to spend a quality life where living together adds more meaning to life, altogether. 
Adversities are the test of time where the true relationship are realized and understood.  Holding hands together and walking along in the dusty storm is what counts  above everything,specially when one finds that the world is not with him. 
Everyone of us sees the brighter part of life, looking for lots of fun to go with but I slightly vary with my things. No doubt leisure and treasures of life are part of it, but not the ultimate goal for me.

"Am friendly by nature, like a good intelligent conversation on any topic from Sports to metaphysics, ...eager to learn more everytime. 

Studied and grew up in Mumbai, but love my native place Goa being a Goan. 

Need to learn to be constant, patient and to control the speed of my thoughts. Am an avid Soccer Lover and a Sports fan. Cant miss on important Sport events especially Soccer World Cup, International cricket match when Indias playing. 

Am curious, sociable and mentally very active, like communicating with people, need variety, change, travel and exchange of ideas. 

Get acquainted with others, easily adjusting to any conversation. 

Although I like freedom and tend to get bored easily with people, am very dependent on those I admire or love. I like to be with close friends, especially the possibility of commenting and talking about everything I experience. Like trips to novel and different places.I enjoy singing, dancing, a good soccer match.

Am the one, people come to when a crisis is at hand,  thrive under pressure and seek situations involving unpredictability and quick thinking. I prefer to leave the planning to others while i thrive on to grab an assignment and run with it. 

Aim is to have a balanced life to ensure i enjoy the economical, spiritual, mental, creative, the metaphysics... aspects

"At 185 centimeters, I tend to stand out walking among the crowd in Bangkok, the place I was born and where I now live. I spent my childhood here until I was 9 years old, when I went to India to receive my secondary education and learn about my Indian heritage. Then off to the USA for my university degrees. But Thailand is always home to me. 

I was a commercial pilot but had to give it up to take care of my family's real-estate business. I do miss it sometimes, the feeling of flying, being in the cockpit, in control and taking on the responsibility. On occasions, I still fly, but most of the time I just take my Harley Fatboy out for a ride about town, especially during the cool months. 

I am quite busy with work but I always make time at the end of the day to hit the gym to unwind. My weekends are pure relaxation and fun like hanging out with my buddies, chilling at home and seeing some movies. I see my parents often. We would watch Indian movies together and have a good conversation over a nice meal. They always ask me when I would find a nice girl to be with. My reply to them is always, ' What is a few years wait for a lifetime of happiness?'. They would just smile. 

I do believe in fate. All around me I see couples who have met in most unlikely of places under most unique circumstances. When it is time, fate brings two people together doesn't matter how far apart they are. But the trick is to see the signs or you'd wasted the chance for life's happiness. 

I am a romantic. There, I am not ashamed to admit it. I love a woman with beautiful smile who can light up a room with her radiance and a laugh that sings like beautiful music. I prefer a traditional Indian woman who is not afraid to break tradition once in a while. Live on the wild side a little. ;)",have 600 different kind of smile :),will tell ya later dear;),23 to 33,08 Dec 1969,16:07:00,Thailand,Others,Athletic,Slim,,,,,,Fair ,Fair,Self,Other School/ Graduation,"43 yrs, 6ft 2in,<br />

When I am passing by a church, gurudwara or masjid, my hands immediately fold into a Namaste as a mark of reverence. For me all religions are the same and lead to almighty. ItA?s just that each one professes it in a different way. My soul mate should respect my sentiments. For a relationship to be successful, it must be based on mutual understanding.

,,"Turned 30 this year and am learning that getting older really does make u a bit wiser... Enjoying the smaller things in life because I know life is short and time will not stand still for anyone. Hoping to share those moments with loved ones to make them as memorable as possible. 
To be just a bit more descriptive about myself... I am a down to earth person who appreciates the simple and extravagant things in life. I'm trendy yet practical.... love to keep up with what's in and what's not! ---but, don't get me wrong, i don't let them dictate who i am.... 
About who I want to meet on shaadi.... definitely someone who is here to find love for life. I'm sure most of us on here r searching for this but for those who aren't, please don't waste anyone's time. 
best of luck to all of you. take care and God bless.
