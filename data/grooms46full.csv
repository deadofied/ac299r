"Hi, I am a committed and talented christian. My Dad was POOVANMALA VILAYIL family in THUMPAMON NORTH near Elavumthitta and Mom hails from PANAMPALLY FAMILY LINEAGE in KULANADA. Paternal Granma was from KALAYIL FAMILY. 
Ours is business family and I am assisting in the management part. 
I possess ORDINARY looks.God has blessed me with versatile talents in the fields of Singing, Music, Writing, Interpretation, Evangelism, Preaching, Teaching, Counselling, Free-lancing etc. 
God healed me thru Music-Ministry and later blessed me with musical talents. I have composed lyrics and music for many Christian Songs.
I feel that all of us should use all the God-Given Talents n Gifts for the Glory of God. Otherwise we will be held accountable for the same one day. 
I am in search for a Qualified Girl who is equally or more talented because I am very particular that MY BETTER HALF SHOULD BE A PERSON WHO ADDS MUSIC n MELODY TO MY LIFE and OTHERS also.  
As an interpreter, God has used me with many frontline Preachers, Evangelists n Speakers. Once I got the privilege to serve as an interpreter to His Excellency Dr APJ Abdul Kalam The President of India. 
If you too are desirous of serving the Lord with all your being and touch many lives with the love of the Lord then feel free to contact me. Please come up with your queries and I request you not to jump into wild conclusions. God bless you as you prayerfully explore this proposal.","My partner should be a talented girl with versatile talents especially in the fields of music, public speaking and leadership. She should be a devout Christian who understands the importance of touching many lives with the love of Christ. She should have the heart to love the unlovable and should be ready to serve the Lord along with her Career. She should be a compassionate person who cares to serve the downtrodden and the needy. She needs to understand that all the talents which she possesses comes from the Lord and it is imperative to use all God-given talents for the Glory of God and that we will be held accountable if we don't do so. She should be willing to pursue the will of God and do all what pleases him. She should be good at cooking too. I assume that she should have the traits of a true Christian women in word and deed.","My father belonged to the POOVANMALA VILAYIL HOUSE in  THUMPAMON (NORTH) near Elavumthitta. He went to be with the Lord in the year 1992 while praying a closing prayer in the Sunday Service. My mom belongs to the Panampally family lineage from Kulanada. My paternal Granma was from KALAYIL FAMILY.
Our family is involved in the business of tyre remoulding and retreading in Chhattisgarh state (formerly in Madhya Pradesh). Our business is doing very well by the grace of God.
I have 3 Brothers n a Sister. I am the second in the family. I have an elder brother who is married from KUNNATHU Family. He is blessed with a Son.
Next to me is my sister who is a Central Govt Employee. The other two brothers are also involved in our family business.

"I'm looking for my long term lover that will cause my heart to skip, leap, and warm at the sight of her. Not because she is young and beautiful, but because she owns my heart, and I know that her heart is owned by me as well. 

I am perhaps too sensitive and probably too damn nice for some of you. I enjoy making you happy, and have been accused of being a people pleaser, which I don't think is as bad as those that have said that think it is. I have learned that some view arguing as a ""love language"" itself, not in a mean-spirited way...just to let you know I care enough to argue a point with you. So...I can be taught. 

I enjoy staying fit and finding new ways to exercise. Although I may appear thin, my shoulders are more than adequate for a safe resting place. Hey...maybe I'll post a shirtless pic...I've heard that's a real plus on this site (how do you enable the sarcasm font again?) All of that to say, I do take care of myself physically and would appteciate that in a partner as well. However, if you want me to train for a marathon or 100 mile bike ride with you, you will have to be patient and let me work up to it as long distance torture is not my first choice. 

When I'm happy, I sing. When I'm sad, I... wait a minute.. I'm never sad!! (LOL...a little inside humor for some of you kinder souls on here...thx).

"Leaving out details that are already there, let me say that i am born into an iyer (tamilian brahmin) family with liberal values.  the only brahminical hang-up i entertain is being vegetarian.  i do not smoke or drink.  i believe that the institution of marriage is made for two sensible, intelligent and thinking adults who have decided to live together for life, respecting each other's feelings and vow complete faithfulness.  i would only respond to girls/ladies who feel comfortable enough to respond directly to me.  hey, after all, we re adults arent we?  Those that are coy or shy, may pl. ask their parents/relatives to contact my parents (i ll forward your msg. to them).  This is because i believe in equality.  you get to to me direct and i speak.  you want to take a round-about route, i ll have to do the same.  i an interpreter/translator by profession, am an officer in the central government, gross about 25,000 a month, work 9 to 5 30 5 days a week.  like to spend time at home and for myself and my hobbies which include films, music, travelling, reading and others.  I do not believe in living to work but work to live.  i am looking for someone who is not above 35, is good-looking (my concept being above five foot 3, not over-weight, not very dark, with no physical deformities).  educated, able to think and speak english (i speak four other languages - hindi, tamil, french and german but i prefer communicating most in english), is employed in a 9 to 5 job in the NCR, who has never been married, does not smoke or drink and is a VEGETARIAN (i would not want a non-vegetarian to give up her like for me, it is unfair and thus only vegetarians need reply) and is not a party animal (i am not averse to parties, only refuse to do it all the time).  the lady should believe in marriage, willing to commit oneself to a single man all her life (hey, i ll do the same, to the lady of course), would NOT put career over me.  and the usual jazz, should have a sense of humour etc etc.","i am looking for someone who is not above 35, is good-looking (my concept being above five foot 3, not over-weight, not very dark, with no physical deformities).  educated, able to think and speak english (i speak four other languages - hindi, tamil, french and german but i prefer communicating most in english), is employed in a 9 to 5 job in the NCR, who has never been married, does not smoke or drink and is a VEGETARIAN (i would not want a non-vegetarian to give up her like for me, it is unfair and thus only vegetarians need reply) and is not a party animal (i am not averse to parties, only refuse to do it all the time).  the lady should believe in marriage, willing to commit oneself to a single man all her life (hey, i ll do the same, to the lady of course), would NOT put career over me.  and the usual jazz, should have a sense of humour etc etc.","I have a younger brother who teaches 11th and 12th standard in a reputed school in delhi.  he is looking for something better (school principal, lecturership etc.).  he is financially independent and does not depend anyway on me.  my parents live with me.  they are not dependent on me.  i am dependent on them.  relatives are all in madras.  nothing worth mentioning about them as they are not likely to figure in my married life (they live too far)",29 to 35,10 Jun 1967,13:36:00,India,Chennai,Athletic,Doesn't Matter,,,,Delhi,,Fair ,Doesn't Matter,Self,MA (Arts),"46 yrs, 5ft 11in,<br />

"I am a self-made person who has finally found his feet in this crazy but lovable city.  Have remained single this long because I wanted to have myself firmly secure and also because I never found the right person.  Am financially very sound, no encumbrances whatsoever.  Am a Class-I Officer in the Government of India.  Am an individual that hates negativity.  My priority in life is my family (which obviously would later include the wife and kids) and I would never sacrifice the well-being of my near and dear ones for career or money.  Speak the truth as much as possible, think straight and go for the jugular if needled.  Have no vices (except being something of a control freak).  Enjoy the good things in life, am vegetarian, a teetotaller and a non-smoker.  I would like to qualify myself (objectively!!!) as articulate, well-mannered/groomed, modern in outlook (does not mean partying all saturday nights!!!), hailing from a very cosmopolitan background.  believe in fair-play and complete commitment and faith in marriage.  Love good music, films and books.  Enjoy travelling for pleasure (I travel for work, but then that's WORK!).  Speak five languages with equal fluency.  That's enough of autobiography I guess!!","Ideals are in the realm of imagination.  So, the person who'll make a good wife to me (trust me, I'll make a sincere effort to try and match up to her expectations of being a good husband) is someone with a 9 to 5 job (when I say 9 to 5, I mean it!), who works to keep her mental faculties working and her purse full and not someone who is obsessed with work.    Would expect, besides the usual jazz of - decent looking, family values etc., the girl to be a delhi/ncr based (or at least willing to settle in Delhi) VEGETARIAN (Sorry, I can't stand the other smells!), a teetotaller, a non-smoker and NOT a party-pooper.  Ideal professions besides 9 to 5 would be teaching or own business.  Basically, something that gives her time for herself and then for me because marriage to me means togetherness. Should be willing to co-exist with my parents who are more likely to be great friends of her and be very supportive than be a pain!!!",,,10 Jun 1967,13:36:00,India,Chennai,Athletic,Doesn't Matter,,Brahmin,Brahmin,,,Very Fair ,Doesn't Matter,Self,MA (Arts),"46 yrs, 5ft 11in,<br />

"I introduce myself as a simple and positive thinker who always finds something good in his life. I take up life as it is and don't crib for trivial things. In my professionals life, I am a very committed and sincere person. Presently I am working as a Divisional Business Manager. I want to attain a good position in my profession and reach the pinnacle of success. My parents are my role model and I give them sheer importance in my life. My mother is a homemaker and father is an Agriculturist. I have two brothers, one of them is an Agriculturist and happily married and the other one is also married and is working in medical field. I also have a sister who is happily married and well settled. After my schooling education, I have completed my B Sc from DVS College and B Ed from Annamalai University. My life is incomplete without the love and support of my friends. They are the ones who always help me in my problems. I have very few friends and I like to watch movies with them and travel. Further I also like watching movies and surfing on internet.","A relation only lasts with mutual respect, trust, loyalty towards each other; transparency in thoughts and most importantly love.
The girl who will get married to me will have the choice to work or not. I will never force her for anything rather will help her to fulfill her dreams and aspirations. She must be well educated and must pose a good family background. In addition to this, she should be well settled in life. 
Mainly she should be simple like me which will help both of us to gel with each other well. 
I am mature enough to understand that it will take some time for her to adjust with my family but once she gets to know my family well then I am sure she will have no problems in adjusting with them. Further I would expect some understanding from her as it will help in leading a stress free and happy life in future.  
If she is like the one I am searching for then I assure her a happy and a prosperous future ahead.

"When one looks at death around and the manner human being are treated with.... just wonder how crude one can be. Thus, not a good person but a reasonable one. Athletic body, into finess, early raiser n jogger a walker in the still morning... life is beautiful and so precious too.  

Hate city life though living in... but then again jostling through those crowd and hustle through those traffic which gives you high pressure... is challenging and an experience that is lovable. hence... enjoy that too.

In the mean time, in one one of those villages, which seems time has forgotten is the place love to belong.. A still night on a block cart al fresco eying the starry night, maybe with a gentle breeze. fresh burning wood smoke smell, first rain on earth the smell bring  to you.... that where I belong. off the beaten track, the music that sooth you, put you at rest, calms and gives peace... not those brings the animal instinct in you. 

Bit sensitive, full of humour though retreived at times,  hate washing though do it daily (almost), eat anything ... doesn't mean that way... it means burnt food and too salty ones... useful cook. like to have everthing in place &amp; neat too but never where I sleep.","In my opinion, all women are  beautiful except the lazy ones... you must hav got it by now. need some one share those small things like a early morning jog, a walk in still chilly night, a coffe at a way side boutique, not a regular temple goer but you go n come back shall wait outside on the step or under tree waiting and have nice chat eat some peanuts seated there.  these small things means a lot grows big.  Unusually, like one who is more educated than me, who can keep me on my toes with her intelligence n knowledge, love that, love knowledge,  a good talker, for God sake dont nag...   would run away to the end of the world. Strongly believe in 50 fifty, men are not or nor longer or never superior to the women. could be a louzy cook but occasionally be a class cook else I got to do it never mind that but but you may have to have a fire extingusher by you else.....

She must be of a positive disposition, always ready to see the silver lining of the cloud. I may seem to be an extrovert since I make friends easily. But underneath I am an intensely private person.

"People tell me I am warm and caring and with a sense of mission in life. A journalist by profession, I am well-read and seek out intellectual pursuits. Thanks to my profession, I have been able to travel across the country on interesting assignments and meet people outsidem my own social orbit.

I strongly believe in using my position in society to bring about a positive difference in the lives of others. My profession offers me a number of opportunities which I try to utilize to the maximum extent possible.

However I have no use for mindless religious rituals.

I enjoy the company of friends though I am not a party animal. I enjoy quiet evenings chatting up with old pals, movies and music. Books, meaningful cinema, exhibitions and work of art are favourite past-times. Though I used to go on treks and nature walks earlier, work pressures do not let me stay away for long periods anymore.

I am quite careful with money and have managed to acquire the trappings of material prosperity without compromising on my principles.

I am looking for an intellectual-minded and financially independent partner who is compatible with my nature. However I do not believe in dowry or ostentatious displays of affluence.",,We are a family of four. My sister is married and lives in Pune.

"My idea of living life is very simple with a positive outlook towards life. My family is my priority and I never disrespect them. I love to spend most of my time with my family and want to make them feel proud of me. 
Professionally I am a businessman and it requires a lot of time and dedication. I do my work with full authenticity and do fair deals. This is why I have maintained cordial relations with my business associates. My aim in life is to take my business to the height of success. 
My mother is a housewife and father is retired from his profession. I have a brother who is currently engrossed in the advertising business and a sister who is happily married. Further, my family includes my beautiful daughter studying in 12th grade, two sons, one of them is in 10th grade and the other one is in 6th grade. 
In my school education I have completed Intermediate from Kalkaji Government School. I have few friends in my life. I have three children and they are my real support and they are further cooperative in nature.","I am looking for a non working life partner who is well settled. She should be from a good family and must consider my family as her own and accept my children as her own. 
She should be simple in nature so that both of us gel with each other well. Further, she should be flexible and adjustable to fit in to my family. This will help both of us to lead a happy life ahead. One of the major features that I am looking for in my life partner is that she should give due respect to my family and the elder members of my family. 
I will give her the freedom to help in my business if she wants. This will make her feel independent and she will also gain confidence. I am ready to help my life partner in every sphere of life whether it is related to home or outside the home. I will be always there for her and always take care of her needs and aspirations.
I assure her about the happy and prosperous future ahead if she is like the one I am looking for.

"Well, I am pretty easy to get along with. I gel and get along with most people. I am pretty much confident and can hold the attention of people as well as a good conversation. I like having fun, not at the cost of others though. I am quite religious and believe every person is here for a purpose. And for that he has been gifted the necessary strength and qualities. I discovered this only recently, pretty late in life. Live and let live. I do not judge - for good or bad, since it immediately elevates or demotes the other person or you thereby creating an invisible barrier between you and the other person. I also balance the modern values and traditional thinking reasonably well.

At the risk of sounding immodest, I will also say that I am a perfect gentleman, and know how to treat a lady right. Oh, I almost forgot, I have an impeccable character.

I like watching movies (English - action, martial arts or new Hindi), listening to music.... I like Hindi pop, Hindi movie songs, Hindi pop, English pop, Soft Rock, Instrumental - English and Hindi general and classical. Yanni is a favorite. Reading is another good past time... especially John Grisham courtroom Dramas, self-improvement books (like 7 habits of highly effective people, etc.) management books, etc. I used to be very active in martial arts earlier and now work out at the gym or go for a walk or run. While I am not much into sports, I do enjoy watching Cricket and Formula racing on TV. I am very much interested in science, following business developments. I am a big foodie and love all kinds of vegetarian or eggetarian foods.  I love singing and am a good singer. Non professional, though. AND, I am a fan?tastic joke teller :) 

I am pretty much an emotional person... can't and don't want to hide my true emotions. I hate liars and manipulators. 

I guess I am looking for the kind of love one would see in movies ? the romantic dreamer in me?.:). The lady, who is destined to be my partner, will find out after marriage that she will besides being my wife, will always remain my best friend and girlfriend also (keeping the romance alive forever).

After certain events in my life, I have learnt to become unstoppable i.e. if I set out to do something, I follow that doggedly, relentlessly, and do not let up till it is done and achieved. I give it more than 100.","I am looking for a partner who can be not just a wife but also a friend and, well, a soul mate. She should have a sensible head, ambitious, not afraid of challenges in life and take them head on. She should be a homemaker. If she has or wants a career also, that is not an issue. She should be able to tell me straight if she thinks I am wrong. She should have a good family background - no I do not mean money, but reputed family. She should have elegance, charm, poise, and be able to dress, make up, conduct and carry herself well. An attitude is also appealing, though it can misfire also. She should be able to hold an intelligent conversation, and if required and wishes join me in work in office. I must admit I am somewhat inclined towards good looks and a flawless fair complexion. I suppose I am looking for the perfect beauty with brains. Go ahead, call me an MCP if you will, but I am simply being myself and factual instead of hiding behind a mask.  Most importantly, she should be able to love my daughter.

So let me begin with some things about myself... 
I'm an independant with fairly liberal views yet moderate values... I stay in Mumbai with my parents. My younger sister is married and stays in Mumbai. Well getting back to me... 
I love to listen to music... 
I believe in living life... 
I'm looking for that special someone who will be my soulmate and companion and walk this journey hand in hand with me. 
 I'm divorced and this time around I'm looking for someone who understands me and vice versa. 
I believe true marriages are based on companionship, deep understanding, respect for one another and each others families... all the above bound together with love.
