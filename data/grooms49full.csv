"I always prefer to do best for spiritual progress. So, I would like to say that Spiritual progress is better than worldly material progress.

My wife is leading her life with me. She is happy and due to some problem she permitted me for 2nd wife. One who is having such dare to accept two wives for a Muslim &amp; honest man. Allah will provide you lot of bless &amp; happiness in whole life if you are showing your interest in me. I am from a well reputed family and having very good and strong economic position. No need to tel you more about them, because I am leading my life independently. But I always respect to each one of my family as well as complete human being. I am self decision taker and never depend upon anyone. However I am having 1 elder, 2 younger sisters &amp; 2 elder brothers. All are married and happily leading their lives.

"To say a little about myself, I(rajeshcmehta) am a senior media professional having worked in some of the biggest ad companies since last 22 years at a very senior level. Born and brought up in Bombay. Currently I live with my younger daughter (age 12 years) She has got admission in an international boarding school at Gujarat from june 2011, My elder daughter is (age 20) is studying in Pune and staying in a hostel in Pune. I give family values high priority in life, something that I will never give up. I believe in living life to the fullest and I take life as it comes. I am a very religious person. Have immense faith in God and though I have had a very bad marriage which I pulled for 21 years. I would like to depict my views regarding marriage you must have heard people saying that we were married because we were in love but according to me it is the other way round... love is a result of good marriage. Of course it requires some ingredients to hold this notion true... these ingredients are whether both partners share the same goal about life whether they could communicate in every manner the fear/hesitance, his/her behavior in general and also whether you are ready to accept the person she/he is with no wild assumptions, no compromise, and no overlooking or underlooking of facts. I believe in accepting the person as he or she is than force myself to believe that, that person would change afterwards in extremes. If anyone of them is missing then the integrity of marriage is missing. Once these conditions are fulfilled to an acceptable level then marriage is nothing but a pleasurable journey!!! .
My family was in Building Construction business my mother is a home maker. My father is retired. My brother has his own business. My sister is married and settled in Ahmedabad. Currently  i am staying with my younger daughter in mumbai.
I am  born &amp; based  in Mumbai. Though I have been living here for more than 20 years. I am always high on life, and strive to ensure thereAa?a?s never a dull moment. The fragrance of rain drenching the parched earth, the flash of lightning against an ink-blue sky, the temple bells chiming on festival day... itAa?a?s these small pleasures in life that make me happy. I respect all religions and faiths. When I am passing by a church, gurudwara or masjid, my hands immediately fold into a Namaste as a mark of reverence. For me all religions are the same and lead to almighty. ItAa?a?s just that each one professes it in a different way.
My Education:Diploma in Marketing &amp; Sales Management, from Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies (Mumbai,India).
ADMANAa?A s Diploma Course in Advertising Management conducted by Indian Society of Advertisers (ISA) Winner of ISA Adman Trophy (Mumbai,India).

"Hi, I prefer to talk about and thus create a more natural progression and below is my life motto. 

""Do not believe in anything (simply) because you have heard it.

Do not believe in traditions because they have been handed down for many generations.

Do not believe in anything because it is spoken and rumoured by many.

Do not believe in anything (simply) because it is found written in your religious books.

Do not believe in anything merely on the authority of your teachers and elders.

But after observation and analysis, when you find that anything agrees with reason and is conducive to the good and benefit of one and all then accept it and live up to it.""

"Outlook &amp; Personality

I am a strong, independent, self confident and self motivated person. I love to travel, read, learn new things and I also enjoy quiet times to meditate and contemplate. I enjoy quiet long walks, hiking, swimming and exercising regularly as well as the simple pleasures of life like that nature provides eg a nice sunset etc. I love sports and hobbies and am involved in a number of them that include aero-modeling, scuba-diving, skiing, cricket, etc. 
I believe that I have a good mix of eastern and western values. While I am well educated (2 Masters degrees &amp; a CA designation), I am driven by a strong value system where money &amp; status etc mean less to me than sound character and human values. 

Family

I come from a family of professionals. My father (late) was a civil engineer. My brother is a lawyer, is married and has a son and currently lives with my mother (retired teacher) in Bombay. We are a God-fearing family progressive family that has a good mix of eastern and western values.","I am looking for someone who can share these simple things with, someone that I can love and respect and that will reciprocate the same.

"I describe myself as a simple and decent man who is emotional in nature. Further, my personality reflects my hard working nature and true devotion towards my work.
In my professional life I am a very serious person and do my work with complete devotion. Presently I am working as a Deputy General Manager. In future I would like to continue with my profession in the same field and reach the top position in life.
I am a straight forward person and speak freely. I dona??t hesitate in saying anything. Sometimes my straight forward nature gets negative for me but I feel proud as I dona??t talk behind anyonea??s back.
I give due respect to my family and my parents. My mother is a homemaker and father has retired from his profession. 
In my school I was a bright student of my class and have received various appreciations from my teachers. In my higher education sector I have completed B tech from Roorkee University. 
I have very few friends in my life and they are my real support. Further, I like to spend most of my time with them watching TV and travelling to new destinations. I love to listen to some of my favorite tracks as it relaxes me and gives me time for myself.","The girl, with whom I will get married to, should be a simple female with calm and patient nature. She must be homely and must respect the family values we follow. 
I am looking for a non working woman to enter my life who can understand me and bring the best out of me. She should be well settled in her life and must be from a decent family background. She should be well educated and I would prefer a girl from North India region. 
Being a mature person I am aware of the responsibilities at home. Therefore I am ready to share those responsibilities with my wife. This way she will also feel at ease and will also feel support from my side. I will be always there for her and will always support her. I am ready to spend my life with her if she is like the one I am looking for.

"The most difficult part for me, guess I am a person who can speak more comfortably than write down about myself in a few words. Lets try, father leading a happy retired life in jaipur in his own house, he was working with Indian oil corporation, brother settled in UAE with his wife and 2 lovely daughters. Me working with hsbc call center at bangalore, a divorcee with a son who is not in my custody basically no legal obligation in nutshell towards the previous marriage. A happy go lucky guy by nature and a strong believer of laugh and be merry policy and laughter is the best medicine (as suggested by the ID maybe), hate to be sad and lonely, money is important part of life but not everything, looking for a life partner who can be my best friend and companion, her education doesn't matter much as long as she is comfy with this guy who is just a graduate and is pursuing his MBA from ignou. Have a mixed diet of veg and non-veg, love home food, enjoy comedy series specially Tom and jerry cartoons or good comedy films, the other extreme would be action packed thriller or a mixed family drama movie. Enjoy fiction novels and read them as and when I can lay my hands on them, love to travel by car in fact have toured 65% of India by car. umm what else.... more for those who would like to go ahead from here. ps pls do excuse my typos if any my latest pics could not fit I the size they wanted 100kb, imagine compressing a 6'4' guy into it (c height has its own disadvantage), any ways the pic uploaded is an old one as well as the latest one's have been added too(technology can compress a tall guy I guess) The first and the main pic is of the time when I did a small stint in the modeling world but it will give u a fair idea of how I look and the latest pic will tell how I look exactly. Interested !!!!! Want to know More !!!! Contact me, currently not a paid member so I guess I wont be able to send back a personal msg or be able to contact u unless u do write to me your contact nos or email ID. Happy hunting people may you all get the right partner","Somebody who can go along with me keeping in mind the kind of person I am. A person who can bring smiles worth billions on any person face, good in cooking fantastic, lovable nature magnificent, a combination of both no word to describe the feeling, not too good in the kitchen don't worry neither am I. In all a lovable and understanding person is all I want (not too much or too complex a need I guess) in search of a working lady for a life partner though not too much career minded who is good to look at and good at heart ( I hope I am not asking for too much)",,34 to 39,08 Feb 1964,04:30:00,India,,Slim,Slim,,,,,,Fair ,Wheatish,Self,B.Com (Commerce),"49 yrs, 6ft 4in,<br />
