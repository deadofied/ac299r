"I am a simple, self-confident, self-reliant, independent, intelligent, rather down to earth and a brave woman. I should say. I have gentle, quiet, peace-loving personality. I strongly believe and hold as core values the qualities and traits of honesty, sincerity,loyalty, self-efficiency and responsibility. My forte is also hard-work, dedication and a deep sense of commitment. I have faced the ups and downs in life alone, courageously and felt Divine Providence coming to my rescue. I believe in ""Where there is a will, there is a way"". I am disciplined and a determined person too. God has blessed me with chunks and chunks of perseverance that has led me to be the person I am now, without giving up. I am also an adaptable, reliable, trustworthy, sensitive and conscientious person, transparent to a few who know me well. I enjoy being at home. I also enjoy experimenting with new tastes, styles and ways of cooking. Creativity flows out of me when I venture to do anything, putting my heart and soul into it and I enjoy the outcome and fruit of it. I try to do things well, may be a strength to cherish and keep up, as well as a limitation to work upon. Money is not everything in life for me, though it is required all the same. My way of unwinding at the end of the day is by using internet to surf, check emails and forward them, keep in touch through chats, and also just lie down and relax. I also love traveling and sight-seeing. I take interest in environment related issues, keenly interested in recycling and reusing materials, garbage disposal, composting, vermiculture. I adopt Eco-friendly ways in my day to day life whenever and wherever I can. I also like gardening, nurturing plants and taking care of Mother Earth, saving electricity, judicious use of water. I take interest in current affairs. Work keeps me updated with whatever happens around the globe. Empty mind is a devil's workshop.","Life is to give and receive support for the ones we love and that's exactly what I am looking forward to. I decided to look for an eligible partner now. I am on the look-out for a good, enthusiastic fun-loving with a good sense of humour, who will enable me to enjoy each and every moment of our life,preferably a Goan, Roman Catholic, well settled in life. Open-minded, broad-minded, encouraging,supportive, who will be able to love, simple, with good human values; hopefully a positive thinker who will be able to understand me, with a golden heart. I am on the search for the one who can give me that security, warmth, who can stand by me in all modes of life, adaptable. I look forward to living with a man who respects women, gives freedom and space to live life peacefully. I am looking for someone who is hard working, honest, other centered and caring. Someone I would enjoy being with. For me is important to have someone I can discuss and chat with, someone interested in starting a home. ","I come from a good family grounded in strong and deep faith in God. As kids we all did what others did, stayed and played and prayed together.

"To say a little about myself I work in a business concern, born and brought up in Bombay. 

I live with my family... who have inculcated great values in me which I am proud of. My family has always supported my in my endeavours and has always been there for me. 

I give family values high priority in life, something that I will never give up. 

I believe in living life to the fullest and I take life as it comes. My most prized posesssion is my smile... which I dress up with everday... as I believe that a smile is something which costs nothing but pays like anything in life. A simple smile could change the world around you. I'm sure you will agree with me in this matter. 

I am a moderately religious person. Have immense faith in god and believe that marriages are made in heaven and I truly believe that... God has the right person in store for us... whom he brings along when he feels the time is right!!!

Lastly I wouldlike to depict my views regarding marriage you must have heard people saying that we were married because we were in love but according to me it is the other way round... love is a result of good marriage. Of course it requires some ingredients to hold this notion true... these ingredients are whether both partners share the same goal about life whether they could communicate in every manner the fear/hesitance, his/her behaviour in general and also whether you are ready to accept the person she/he is with no wild assumptions, no compromise, and no overlooking or underlooking of facts. I believe in accepting the person as he or she is than force myself to believe that, that person would change afterwards in extremes. If anyone of them is missing then the integrity of marriage is missing. Once these conditions are fulfilled to an acceptable level then marriage is nothing but a pleasureable journey!!!",,,44 to 50,05 Mar 1964,,India,Mumbai,Average,,,Vaishnav Vania,,,,Fair ,,Self,B.Com (Commerce),"49 yrs, 5ft 6in,<br />
