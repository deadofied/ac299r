"Personality: I have lived at many places in India and north America and I need not say that I respect all the cultures, religions etc. Of all the places I have lived at, I like Vancouver and Delhi the most. I would like to describe myself as an optimistic, a fighter and yes, witty. I am a voracious reader-a habit quite common in my family-read anything I can put my hands on, but of late, I have been reading a lot on serious political issues (ranging from India to Ireland to Mid-East), but I love reading lighthearted once in a while-I just finished re-reading all the Tom Sawyer series-took me thru my childhood. This habit of reading has made me capable of thinking from multiple viewpoints and has helped me being tolerant and adjustable. Rest, I believe you can better judge someone only after meeting him or her for a couple of times. 
Long Term Goals: I have been teaching Physics in a local college. I never thought I could ever be a teacher leave aside being a good one. But I realized that I like most when I am around my students. And at times I don't hesitate going a little out of way to help my students and its very rewarding to see when they try to do the same for me. However, I intend to change my path to WORK in non-profit sector (and this is something other than social work). We can talk about it more when we get in touch. And finally, here are some things I am looking in the person I would want to share my life with: someone with moderate-cum-traditional outlook, genuinely compassionate for society, trustworthy and faithful, optimistic and interested in literature, able to hold conversation in different situations &amp; certainly not a braggadocio type- a thorough gentleman. This is a life-long relationship and I can tell you one thing for sure, I will give my 100%. It would be a relationship where we would be each others strength and where we would go thru every good or bad phase of the life together.",,,33 to 35,24 Jul 1978,,,,Athletic,,2 brothers ,Sikh - Jat,,,,Fair ,,Self,M.Sc.

"Hello! I have completed my Masters in Computer Applications. I am currently working as a Team Lead in the Software division of a reputed MNC. 
My friends describe me as: lively, friendly, trust worthy, good listener, a little introvert but once I get to know the person well, there would be no dull moment and to add romantic too.
Values: I believe in honesty, sincerity - be it work or personal life, live and let live attitude, respect for elders and lot of love for children, believe in giving and sharing all the beautiful things of life, love to help the needy and always there to help anyone who needs me. 
Hobbies: I love to read (fiction/non-fiction), cooking (experimenting :P ), travelling, arts and craft, calligraphy and handwriting analysis. 
Views on marriage: Marriage is about trust, companionship, complimenting each other, balancing highs and lows in life and being there for each other come what may. Marriage accordingly to me is such a pure and ethereal bond that should grow strong with years, its more of a special 'something' that two people share and come to realise a special feeling that the world calls 'love'. And last but not the least, respect for each other and the strength to stand for each other in trying times.
They say marriages are made in heaven and even though the wait is long 'someone somewhere is made for each one of us'. Waiting to find the special someone that God has chosen for me. Lets see if you can find me before I find you. 
I am looking for a life partner who is understanding, caring, smart, intelligent, at the same time down to earth. (However, cliched all this may sound, its very important)He should have respect for elders and someone I should be able to look up to. Some one who will be more of a friend, with whom I can share and talk anything under the sun. He should be easy going, loves to enjoy life, explore places and different cuisines.","I am looking for a life partner who is understanding, caring, smart, intelligent, at the same time down to earth.

A very jolly person with good sense of humour, independent and mature enough to comprehend and can really compromises with the circumstances. Knows the art of really handling critical situations and complex issues. Because what she believes is ""Compromising"" doesn't mean u r wrong &amp; someone is right. It only means that you value your ""Relationship"" much more than your ""Ego"". She takes great care of her elders and treats all with love, respect and courtesy. She has high concern for family values and ethics. As already mentioned that she is being bought up in a big family which makes her capable enough to even adjust herself with people of all personality and temperament with confident. Being a brother I can assure you of the fact that anyone who would be her soulful mate will surely be getting a very homely partner for his lifetime.","The person for my sister should be honest, hard working, understands the family values and has respect for women, that is the most important thing he should posses.

Inherently I am very much a girl next door - soft spoken, straight forward, blessed with a  high EQ, good voice, presentable looks, and an independent nature.

Since Dad was in a nationalised bank, I have been convent educated all over India. Graduation has been from LSR, St. Xavier's college and post graduation has been from Mumbai University.

I have worked with Vodafone and thereafter as a creative writer for close to 7 years, but a 9 to 9 job isnt something I wish to stick to for my entire life. keeping in mind the long term aspect, I have shifted to education, and enjoying it a lot.

Music, films, writing, fitness activities and spirituality are things which keep me happy. Have learnt classical music as a child.

Lizards and complicated directions are few of the things I despise.

"Welcome to my self introduction. Presently I am in Moscow, Idaho a place in a serene natural setting far from the maddening crowd that I love very much. Three years of my very early life were spent in Holland and Taiwan. After that the entire part of my school and college life of nineteen years was spent in Kharagpur, West Bengal. Then I landed in USA, University of Maryland, College Park to complete my Ph.D. in Mathematics in 2007, and spent two years in Arizona State University, and one year in Princeton University as a Post-doctoral fellow. My childhood was nurtured in a religious environment instituted by my mother and a strict academic discipline perpetuated by my father.

I have too a strong faith in religion particularly in truthfulness. I am an avid reader of classic novels, travel a lot-I hate having my life disrupted by routine, love to watch movies, tennis, cricket and listen to music. I love teaching and research too- reward and recognition are fine, but they cannot be achieved without diligence. Good teachers talk less because their students are talking more.

Thanks for your patience and time for caring my humble template. I wish all of you boundless joy and creativity in your life.",,,33 to 37,21 Mar 1978,06:28:00,United States of America,Kolkata,Average,Doesn't Matter,,Kayastha,Bengali,Others,,Very Fair ,Doesn't Matter,Daughter,Ph.D. (Doctorate),"35 yrs, 5ft,<br />

He should be from a good family background residing in Delhi/NCR region. Further, I believe that smoking is injurious to health therefore; I would expect my husband to be free from such activities. He should not indulge in such activities as it is something that I cannot stand. 
He should be a pure vegetarian like me and also believe in family values. My family is my priority and he must also respect my family. This way I will have no problem in adjusting and respecting his family.

Marriage is not just an  institution bt it is the most pious realtion but unfortunately people take it as a fun. A marriage knot tied on the foundation of lies and frauds is not a marriage. It is shere selfishness and greatest sin in the eyes of God.Now you can well imagine what could have happened. Believe in your instincts and then proceed. This is all i can say.

"I represent myself as a simple person who likes to stay away from the complexities of life. I also like to live my life simply. My soft spoken nature has always been adored by everyone and I have received many appreciations for this.
Currently I am working as a Teacher and I am happy with my professional life. In the upcoming time I would like to be in the same profession. 
My major weakness is that I am very emotional so the ones who are close to me take care of this fact and do not make fun of me.  
I am a family oriented person and like to spend most of my time with my family members. My mother is a homemaker and father is a retired government officer. 
After my school education I did BA and MA from Hp University.
There are very few friends in my life and I like to be near them. They always listen to me and help me when I am in need. In my free time I like to listen to music, watch movies, read books and travel to new places.","I want to get married with a simple and understanding person. He should understand me and my feelings so that he gets to know me well. I want my husband to be a family oriented person who also likes to spend time with the family. He must respect my family members and also give them importance. This way even I will respect and accept his family members. 
My life partner can pursue any profession and I have no choices regarding the profession of my life partner. He should be well qualified in his professional front and must be ready to get married. The family background of my husband should be good and they should be renowned in the society for their decency. Personally I would prefer a simple and decent man from Himachal Pradesh. 
I am ready to fill his life with love and happiness if he is like the one I have always desired for.

"I am a very simple person wishing to have a simple life. I value traditions and culture. I recite suprabhahtam often while I enjoy reading Ayn Rand and Paulo Coelho. I am a strong believer in God.

He does visit us often. I like my parents a lot. I was married in 2002, got separated in 2005 and currenty awaiting divorce. Just a note about me as a clarification. Though I am a simple woman with life's simple desires, people often mistake me for not as sophisticated. However, I have a fairly high sophisticated values and expectations about life and my future partner. I consider myself a liberated professional Indian women with extensive Western cultural exposure due to my upbringing. I am looking for someone who is responsible and caring. Who loves to be with the family. He must understand the need to support my mother even after our marriage. She is all alone and has no one except me.

"I am outgoing and look forward to new experiences to enrich my ability to better understand people from all walks of life. I get along mostly with people who are down to earth and have a zeal for life. I love to laugh and believe that humor in life is very important. Life is too short, so I believe in making the most of every single day by doing good deeds and keeping the people we love and care for happy.

I came to the United States 8 years ago to pursue higher education, have received a B. S and M. S in Computer Science. Besides studies, throughtout my time here I have constantly tried to gain from my social interactions. I believe am a good blend of the goodness I came with and the exposure that I am currently getting. I believe in being open-minded, making the most of every chance I receive to improve upon myself and to learn from.

I have been working as a systems analyst for the past 3. 5 years with a mutual fund company based out of Boston, MA. I enjoy my work a lot and try my best to strike a balance between work and personal life.

I try to make the most of the summer time by going for hiking trips, going for long walks and long drives. If not outdoors, I enjoy watching comedy movies and reading non-fictions. And... at times just doing nothing on a weekend. I love entertaining and frequently have friends over, with whom I love to sit back, laugh and relax. I love to cook and love it even more when my friends and family enjoy it!

Charity of any kind is very close to my heart and not a day goes by when I am not thankful for the very blessing that allow me a healthy existence and keep those I hold dear in good health.

I am very close to my family and regard family very highly and would like to have a life partner who believes in the same set of values. I look forward to getting to know someone who is simple yet interesting. Down to earth and humourous are crucial. I am in the quest for a good life where I am married to a friend and look to gain a family so each day is truly valued for what it is worth.",,,,14 Jul 1978,,United States of America,,Average,Doesn't Matter,,Kayastha,,,,Wheatish ,Doesn't Matter,Sister,MA (Arts),"35 yrs, 5ft 4in,<br />

"A very down to earth, sensible, sober, god fearing girl, someone who values every moment in life. i love relations and believe that every relation involves mutual reciprocation. Relationships-of all kinds-are like sand held in your hand. Held loosely, with an open hand, the sand remains where it is. The minute you close your hand and squeeze tightly to hold on, the sand trickles through your fingers. You may hold onto some of it, but most will be spilled. A relationship is like that. Held loosely, with respect and freedom for the other person, it is likely to remain intact. But hold too tightly, too possessively, and the relationship slips away and is lost, looking forward for a blissful relationship of love, trust and compatibility.",,"I belongs to the family of defense, my father is a gallantry medal awardee from BSF.he is retd as Commanding Officer.

"I am a fun loving, optimistic, cheerful and ofcourse ambitious girl living in Jaipur, India with parents. I am seeking for a partner who is intelligent with good sense of humor and modern thoughts.

I can't live with a person who is modern outside and orthodox from inside. Sorry people if you are something like this or living in family like this. We are two different streams in two opposite directions. 

Mamma's baby also excuse me please. You are mature enough and still you can not go without your mamma in life, please excuse me.

For me respecting elders and follow them blindly are two different things. I also live in a family and a society and know how to respect elders and love youngers. I also love my family a lot, respect them a lot but i have my own personality too and expect my partner to be same with his own personality and views. He must be mature enough who can judge what is wrong or right and take is decision on his own. 

I just can't be artificial. what's in my heart, one can find easily if he/she knows me.

I believe in live life as it comes. I believe in today and dont believe in regreting for past. I am very sensitive, caring and a lil bit naughty, talkative girl. 

I have done B. Sc. in home science. My hobbies are 3Ms (Masti, Movies and Music). Although i like travelling, reading, chatting with friends, cooking also. 

But let me make a thing very much clear that i just hate fake people and those who don't fulfill their commitment....

so that's enough about me for now, so u think we are like mind contact me. There is a lot more to know about me. 

But as this is not a social networking site, we all are here for some serious purpose so if you are serious enough then only contact me.","My partner should be my friend. And not a mamma's baby please. Should be mature, intelligent and strong enough to take his own decisions. I want to walk with my partner on his side, i just dont want to follow him or want him to follow me. Life is not very serious or bore or long if we have time to laugh so having a good sense of humor is not bad.

I think neither a woman nor a man is complete without each other and everybody has its equal role and place in another's life so seeking for a partner who can make me complete and allow me to complete him.",I belong to a veg family and i expect from my patrner to be same.

"Hi, My sister is a freelance Journalist &amp; a Media Professional. Based in Mumbai since birth, she did her schooling, bachelor studies and master's all in Mumbai. She picked up her career at a young age while pursuing her graduation and chose to move on with our father's publication. Its been few years now, that she has added her own publication as well. As a person, I would describe her as most loving, caring and a lively person to be with. She loves to give back to the society and hence does a lot of social work as well. All of us, and of course other people close to her say that she absolutely down to earth, most approachable, lively, friendly, Jovial, loving, caring &amp; respectful girl. All that she believes she is, a no-nonsense person who loves life and respects it, a person who takes life as a challenge and takes over confidently with a happy spirit, a person who believes in solutions then stressing about problems, a person who feels nothing tops priority than family and close ones. Loves to enjoy every moment, loves to travel, understands fitness and loves to work out. She also believes, that learning is a continuous process and that keeps her motivated big time. She keeps adding to her knowledge, many new areas out of sheer interests of knowing more into it. While looking for a partner, all that she would have in mind, is a person who understands and respects life &amp; family. A free spirited, open minded &amp; cultured partner, who believes in similar values. Someone who respects her profession and her identity. Some one who is looking forward to settle down with a like minded partner and can see a future together is what we are looking at when we look for a partner for her.",,,42 to 47,30 May 1978,,,,Average,,,Brahmin - Saraswat,"Brahmin,CKP",,"Other College, Mumbai University",Fair ,,Sister,MBA/PGDM,"35 yrs, 5ft 4in,<br />

"Hi, I am Santosh Rokade and am Rupali's brother. Rupali is younger to me by only 2 years, but we are the best friends. We spent our childhood in Dhule, where we rose from a very weak financial situation to one of well-stabled position of today. Her role in managing this transformation is very crucial and that had made her self-made. She did her schooling in St.Xavier, Canossa Convent High School and Junior college in Jai hind senior College both in Dhule. After our initial long stay in Dhule, we shifted to Pune (Pimpri) as our Mother who rose from a part time Aanganwadi school teacher to a Supervisory role and as routine part was transferred there. It was in Pune that Rupali completed her graduation in Commerce and did Advance Course in Computerized Fashion Technology. After I got job in Mumbai, we shifted here and now She runs 2 firms: a) guides women (particularly those shifting to foreign countries) in dress designing, mehendi, zardosi, khakha work, glass painting, fur toys making and many more. b) directs and manages a Civil Services Coaching academy of her own,
This she does from home and also as such manages our home. She arranges all traditional Hindu functions like haldi-kunku, Shree Satyanarayan pooja, Gauri-Ganpati poojan, Hartalika, Navratra, and is admired by all for beautiful artistic decorations, Rangoli and above all for being a good host. And at the same time i can say that she learns a lot from watching TV channels like ET, CNBC, NDTV 24 X 7 and likes.What I can say is that she is a perfect blend of modern and traditional values. She loves to have family and is profound lover of music, art, pet animals, songs, traveling, cooking &amp; People &amp; children.","We r looking for a decent and  matured partner  with understanding nature.He should be a friend of hers and us too.  Not at all a male chauvinist. He should spend quality time with her and family and should adhere to values at the same time be moderate in thoughts. A well to do, ambitious, career minded husband can be her best match.
","my mom is Brahmin, dad is parit (dhobi), we have close knit happy family, with strong emphasis on family values, care, and supportive nature. I have been brought up in a Brahmin culture.

"My sister is a talented, caring and beautiful girl with good family values. She loves to excel in all walks of life. She is soft-spoken and well educated and is always among the toppers in any class. At present, She works in a BPO with a reputed company. She loves her family and strongly believes that her parents have given her the best education, values and material goods that they could.

She is skilled in sewing, embroidery, candle and jewellery making . The dresses that she made for small kids will take anyone's breath away :-). She had a small sewing business running from home but now the BPO takes up all of her time. However, she not only gives importance to her career but also values social relations and religious festivals. She is religious and god-fearing. 

She is an excellent cook and makes several delicious north-Indian dishes. Constantly trying out new recipes, she impresses the guests and family with the fact that even when she makes a dish for the first time it always comes out tasty. 

She loves having people over at home for small get-togethers and likes to attend parties. She loves to travel and see different places and is always game for vacationing. As all girls do, she likes shopping ..... a surprise gift, good clothes or jewellery always bring a HUGE smile to her face. 

She loves kids and kids also warm up to her instantly. Her eleven month old nephew always loves it when he sees her and he keeps smiling at her to get her attention.She is very understanding and everyone who meets her like her. 

She used to be a good fan of trekking and hiking. She is extremely good at spoken english, extempore, debates and quizzes. When she teaches any subject, things suddenly become very clear for the student :-)

She had to leave MBBS (medical education) due to an illness that requires her to be on daily medication. She plans to pursue further studies in the near future. 

We are looking for a well-educated, kind, understanding and successful person who would be a real jeevansathi for her.

"Simplicity is something that is very important for a person. However, being simple requires a lot of time. This is something true and I believe that inculcating this habit in oneself is very difficult. I feel very proud to say that I am very simple as a person. 
I have been the same since childhood. People like this in me and appreciate this quality of mine. I never feel proud of the fact that people appreciate me. I take their admiration in a very modest manner. This is the best quality in me, according to me. 
I am a Senior Consultant and I like my work. I wish to excel in the same field in future. Before that, I did graduation in BE (CS/IT) from New Bombay. After that, I started working. 
My mother is a homemaker and my sister is married. I have two brothers and both of them are well flourished business men. My father expired and left us alone in this world. Me and my whole family miss him a lot. Apart from that, I love all my family members and I am proud to have them as the closest people in my life. 
I dona??t have many friends but the few of them that I have are very close to me. 
I like to sing and dance, like any other girl. I enjoy it and this refreshes my mind. I also like to watch movies and listen to music. This soothes my mind the most.","A happy man marries the girl he loves, but a happier man loves the girl he marries. I want to marry the man who will love me after marriage. Therefore, more than anything else he should be very loving and supporting. 
Apart from all this, the family I get married to needs to be very well reputed and behaved. This will make me very comfortable, as I will get a good environment after marriage. This way not only me but my family will also feel very relaxed. 
My partner can be from any profession. All I want is that he should be well settled. This will not only secure his professional but also his personal life. Also, I dona??t want to struggle after marriage and want to live a peaceful life. 
He and his family should accept me as I am. This will make me very comfortable. I will not accept their domination, as I cannot take it. I am sure they will seek a lot of respect from me if they dona??t try to change me. 
He should be very down to earth. This is because people who are like that are very modest and know how to lure others with this habit. Apart from that, I will be a new member in his family so he should take care of me and love me like he loves his other family members. This will comfort me a lot. I am sure I will have a happy life if he is what I want him to be.

"well; not that it is very easy to write about oneself but lets give it the best shot (let me know if i get the Bookers prize for writing well). Jokes apart but here it goes.... 
My mom tells me i have chakras on the soles of my feet (meaning that people with chakras travel a lot). I was born in Visakhapatnam and was brought up in Jamshedpur (You are right.. the steel city). After completing my schooling i studied my graduation in Agra and Post graduation happened in Gangtok (Sikkim). My first job took me to Hyderabad. I moved on from hyderabad to Gurgaon for my second job and then to Mumbai and back again to Gurgaon. And thanks to my job profile i have to be frequently travelling (an average of 10-12 days a month)
i am a strong believer in GOD (though not orthodoxly religious), confident, willing to take on challenges in life (at both the personal and professional front). As much as i am career oriented i am a firm believer that the women is the 'home maker' and family always comes first for me. 
i love to listen to good music (actually i am a versatile listener and can appreciate everything from M S Subbalakshmi to Pearl Jam... and that also without linguistic barriers)
i love photography (somewhat passionately), cooking (reasonably well, my frinds have survived my culinary experimentation :-)) and driving (currently enjoying my Maruti Zen)

My family is also a third generation Dayalbagh Satsangi- you may have to get in touch with me or my parents to understand this because not much can be written about this in this column.","i am looking for someone who is supportive, honest, confident, have a good sense of humor, well qualified and is understanding. Respect for oneself (though not egoistically so) is a must have quality because i have always believe that if you respect yourself; you will also respect me and my family.

"I was born and brought-up in Bombay or Mumbai. I have studied and worked in Mumbai. I have done B.com &amp; have also done Master Diploma in Computer Science. I am working as a teacher for past 7 years. I am currently working for Dhirubhai Ambani International School, Mumbai as a Computer Faculty &amp; as a Student Council Advisor.   My career is important to me and I believe in my capabilities of maintaining a good balance between my professional and personal life. I do believe that one must dream and also try to achieve it but at the same time be smart enough to distinguish between possible and the impossible. Failures, I believe are not the stops to success but the stepping stones to it. Honesty, integrity and loyalty are values I strongly believe in and can proudly say that I have them deeply embedded in me. I am friendly, easy going, helpful and modest by nature. I have always enjoyed adventure sports like trekking, camping, white water rafting and so have been to Hrishikesh - Foothills of Himalayas. I enjoy socialising with selected friends, watching good movies and reading good books, travelling and taking pictures/photography (not professional). Marriage to me would be a life time union between two like minded people who are refreshingly different in their own ways. The twosome, who could spend time in compatible silence or do many different things together, yet offer each other enough space to be their own person. Two people being able to share their innermost feelings and thoughts without the fear of being judged. I am looking for a life-partner who is loving, accommodating and simple in thoughts. I believe trust, understanding and compromise (not sacrifice) are the life support systems of every strong and lasting relationship, so I would expect these qualities in my partner and yes he sure can expect the same from me too. He should be a good friend so that together we can share our good &amp; bad times.

"Social Work has its roots in the social and economic upheaval wrought by the Industrial Revolution; in particular the struggle of society to deal with poverty and its resultant problems. Dealing with poverty was the main focus of early social work and therefore social work is intricately linked with the idea of charity work; but must now be understood in much broader terms. For instance it is not uncommon for modern social workers to find themselves dealing with the consequences arising from many other 'social problems' such as racism, sexism, homophobia, and age and physical/ mental ability discrimination. Modern social workers can be found helping to deal with the consequences of these, and many other social maladies, in all areas of the human services; and many other fields besides.",,,25 to 30,28 Oct 1978,,,,Athletic,,,Vysya,,,Lucknow University,Fair ,,Self,MBA/PGDM,"35 yrs, 5ft 10in,<br />
