I also beleive in giving my best to my married life! I can cook really good food.. atleast that's what everyone tells me : ) I cherish a dream to have a good and meaningful life with my life partner.

"Hello, I am 43, single, never married, a homely and down to earth person. I come from a well brought up and cultured family.
 I am also spiritual and a Krishna devotee, a strict vegetarian. I don?t eat meat, fish or eggs. I am fun to be with and enjoy the company of positive-thinking people, evenings out with a friend or relative.
I enjoy cooking, am a reasonably good cook, or so I?ve been told. Occasionally I do bake cakes, cookies and pastries. I can cook Indian, Chinese, Western and Malaysian vegetarian food. I would definitely love to cook and care for a caring partner. I am also a good homemaker and would move mountains if required for someone I love, who truly loved me. 
I studied until ?O? levels and did some very basic computer courses. My hobbies include watching T.V. especially Bollywood music videos, Hindi films, English films, comedies, cartoons, playing badminton, hearing new Hindi songs and old melody hits sung by Mohd Rafi, Mukesh, Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle and Sonu Nigam. I like singing and expert in playing the harmonium. Daily I go for jogging and my morning walks I like reading books, magazines and going out to the supermarkets for buying groceries and also buying vegetables and fruits. Once in a while I go shopping in the city.
Since my mother and father have passed away, I live part of the year in Kajang, Malaysia and part of the year in Bangalore, India with my sister and brother-in-law. 
I also have a very cute little creamish white furry Shih Tzu dog, small like a puppy. Her name is Rosie. She is a born vegetarian, loves eating all types of tasty, cooked vegetables, cucumber salad, little rice with dhall or sambar, chapatti and fruits like mangoes and papaya and likes to dance around.
I am kind to the poor and like cooking and feeding hungry cows, calves, sometimes bulls, stray dogs and puppies on the streets, once a week and on holy days.","My ideal life partner should be 43-49 years old, never married or legally divorced, single, without children, caring, undemanding, responsible with a pleasant good personality and a good sense of humour. It is also important that he be a Hindu, a strict vegetarian, a non-smoker and a non drinker.
Most importantly he must have a stable and financially secure job as I do not have any particular ambitions of working outside of home.
I speak English and Malay. Just starting to learn a little Hindi and Tamil. If interested, please respond with a recent photo of yourself. Please do read through my whole profile to understand my preferences. If I sound right to you, maybe you the Mr. Right, Mere Jeevan Sathi, that Ia??ve waited all these years to meet.
