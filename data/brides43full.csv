"I am a woman who is passionate about life, education and travel. I will educate myself at any given opportunity whether through self study, formal classes or through travel. I am looking for a partner who shares the same passions as I and more... as I want to travel, discover and explore the world with him, making memorable moments no matter where in the world we are, as long as we are together. I am a very cultural woman who thrives on learning about and experiencing other cultures. Honesty, love and respect are crucial to me in any relationship as I feel they all three go hand in hand. If one of those elements is missing, then there is no relationship in my eyes. I one day hope to be happily married, sharing life together with my partner and of course learning from him as well. My immediate family consists of my father and 1 brother. My father is retired from the local utility company and my mother, who has recently passed away, was retired from their local school system. I also have 1 maternal grandmother living and whom I adore. My family is supportive of me and allows me to make my own decisions but yet gently guides me when guidance may be needed. I do live on my own with my children (50/50 basis), all whom are teens. I'm not looking for a ""father"" for my children, they have their own father who is actively a part of their lives, but I would expect that you be a friend to the children, guiding them and mentoring them. With that said, I am unable to relocate at this time due to my 50% responsibility with the children.",,,37 to 47,14 Mar 1970,05:30:00,,,Slim,,1 brother ,,,,,Very Fair ,,Self,B.Sc (Science),"43 yrs, 5ft 6in,<br />

I feel spirituality is being there for your loved ones rather than going selfishly behind some personal motives at the cost of one's loved ones or at least the ones that depend on you.  I do not believe in any unique path to reach God other than doing the right things at the right time that your conscience tells you to do.  In other words what you would be doing when you knew when noone is looking .

"I am a firm believer of God's GRACE in every aspect of our life whether small or big. Almighty takes every decision in one's life and does everything at an appropriate time, though we at times feel that things are not happening according to our choice, wish and liking. But God's decision is just delayed but never denied if HE wants to give us anything it will be given at the right and appropriate time only and we should have firm faith on HIM and stop doing reasoning. We should wait and watch things to happen and just not jump into conclusions irrationally. If we don't get something that we require, it is still good for us only, because whatever happens is only for our betterment. I expect my partner too have firm faith in God's grace in our each and every activity irrespective of results whether it is in our favor or not at this particular moment. He should take firm decisions with positive bent of mind. Should have pleasing personality and never depressing. Preferably non-alcoholic and vegetarian.

"I AM HIV POSITIVE.

I guess this is where one is supposed to put their best foot forward, make an impression. But I think I shall just try to make an honest attempt at describing myself to the best of my knowledge and then leave it to you to decide if you want to get in touch, because I'm looking for a real, lifelong relationship and for that, we better know each other for who we really are.

So, here goes - I believe I'm a good hearted, attractive, intelligent person who is also fun loving and romantic. 
Most importantly, I am dependable and I don't play games.

I like to work for a living and also value my independence. However, I value people and relationships over everything else and am looking forward to starting a new phase of my life with the person who I will completely depend on for love, friendship, companionship, understanding, and just about everything. Needless to say, he can expect the same from me.

Who am I looking for? - Well, if you like what you've read so far then you're probably my kind of guy. On a serious note, I want someone who has dependable shoulders, the willingness and passion to walk beside his partner through thick and thin. I want someone who is liberal in attitude and lifestyle but has sound moral values. Would like someone who is fairly well educated, intelligent, and fun loving. 

I could go on and on but then I know there's no such thing as a perfect partner, at the end of the day its all about chemistry to begin with and then compatibility. So I shall leave it at this and wait to hear from you.

"I am a cheerful Sagittarian looking for a partner to share the ups and downs of life, where we can be each others best friend. Born in Kolkata but educated across India, I have had a cosmopolitan upbringing. After graduation / post graduation in International Relations from Jadavpur University, Kolkata and a few years working in Kolkata, I moved to Mumbai where I am currently working in a managerial role and enjoying it to the hilt. At the same time I have reached a stage where I would like to share my life with that one special person. 

My likes - I like to travel (have travelled in India &amp; abroad), books (across genres, currently interested in self development), music (once trained in Indian classical, hope to get back to it), eating out (I enjoy restaurants &amp; home cooked food altho not much of a cook yet), and perhaps, most importantly, the company of family and friends. I was not born to be a loner :-)

It is always hard to define who we are looking for without sounding inflexible but I would ideally like my partner to be affectionate, fun loving, with a good sense of humour. I am looking for an individual with diverse interests. He could be living anywhere, doing anything. 

I believe that relationships have to take time to grow, that it develops in a continuum rather than just pop up at a point in time. I would therefore like to start off as friends and see where that takes us.

hi! thanks a ton for visiting my profile. this is proposal for my elder sister who is a B.A.M.S. doctor running her own clinic in nasik succesfully. She has a 0.01% problem in her gait not visible to the eye until told about. But we would like to be honest about it. Let me make it clear that this probem is NEITHER genetic nor related to the brain whatsoever it is purely phisical and has not been a restriction in any normal routine activity ever. my sisters lifestyle is simple. she is God fearing. the person who would be her life partner should accept her for the human being she is and because of the problem she has. IF you are really intersted please get in touch with me. thnk you.,,"Father passed away 2years back. 2 sibling sisters, both married and well settled in life.",40 to 43,11 Jul 1970,,India,,Slim,Doesn't Matter,,Brahmin,,,,Wheatish ,Doesn't Matter,Sister,Other School/ Graduation,"43 yrs, 5ft 2in,<br />

"I would describe myself as a kind, generous, easy-going person. I love to laugh and enjoy funny situations. I enjoy traveling and the adventures of the outdoors. Getting away is important because I think everyone should see what else is out there. I also like going to the movies, theatre, concerts, museums or a nice restaurant. But I am just as happy staying home and hanging out friends and family. I would like to meet someone who has similar interests, but who can introduce different activities into my life. 
My ideal match would be someone who is kind and considerate, generous and thoughtful, easy-going and funny. Someone who is not chained to their job, their computer or cell phone would be a plus. Nothing wrong with being a go-getter, but there has to be a good balance, don't you think? Someone who is mature, responsible and intelligent. Someone who puts butterflies in my stomach. Someone who effortlessly makes me laugh. Someone who isn't afraid to make a decision if needed. It would be nice to find a relationship where each person's personality and attitude compliments the other.
