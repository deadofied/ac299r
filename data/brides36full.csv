"I work for the Malaysian English news daily as a graphic designer. By passion I am fashion art director. When I am not working, I make it a point to spend valuable time with my family members that includes with my cutest and adorable puppy boy too. I love pets especially canines. I am a very simple person, respect people from all walks of life, that's how we have been brought up. I get along fine with everyone as long as they have a pleasant attitude. I do not believe in caste, it is something inappreciable. I love going to temples, and I am on my mission to become a vegetarian, therefore I would prefer someone who is already a vegetarian to inspire me to become a vegan fast. I love traveling and like learning about other cultures and greatly indulged in social work.","The kind of guy I would like to meet is someone who is humble, smart, simple, understanding, respects other living beings and kind at heart.

"Hi, 
I am a simple person with simple expectations from life. Eight hrs a day I am a software professional. I love my work since the quest for perfection is still alive. Beyond work I keep myself occupied with social activities which includes hanging out with friends, cooking something new, or just the outdoors. I like to keep sometime for pursuing individualistic activities like reading or studying something new.

"Hi, i am a very simple and happy-go-lucky kind of a person, taking life as it comes by. I am a bit reserved and take time to open up with strangers but on knowing someone I can get very talkative too. I like people with Jovial nature since I believe humor reduces daily life stress. Apart from this, I love nature, peaceful locations, long drives, am quite fond of painting and traveling too. Our is a moderate nuclear family. And I am attached to all - my father, mother, elder brother, sister in law, elder sister, brother in law and two beautiful nieces. Well, for a life partner, I look for someone who is mature, responsible, understanding. In addition would really like if he is a talkative person with good sense of humor.

To say a few words about myself... I am a straight forward, simple person, independent and open minded. I have a very strong value system, which is my strength. On one hand, I have an analytical bent of mind, like any scientist, on the other hand, I have a good sense of humor. Inclined to music (rabindrasangeet, old film songs). I am friendly to all, and apparently an extrovert, but share my feelings with only my core circle of friends. Frankly, a lot of me reamins within myself...I am a sensitive individual  and respect others perspective, but at the same time dont like to pretend or change myself to please others.

I am a hard working individual and do all my work with great determination. Presently I am working as a teacher in a government school. In future I would like to pursue my career in the same field and attain a reputed position in life.

My mother is no more and father is a retired food inspector. I have two lovely sisters who are happily married and a brother who is currently working as a regional Manager in a Pharmaceutical Company.

There are very few friends in my life and I like to be with them and share my feelings and thoughts with them. Further, in my free time I like to do cooking, watch TV, listen to music and read books.","I am looking for a simple and down to earth man to enter my life.

I have no choices regarding the profession of my husband but he should be well settled. If he is well settled then in future we will have no problems in our life. I would personally prefer marrying a man from UP (Uttar Pradesh). My life partner should be a well educated person with a broader perspective in judging and analyzing life. He should be mature enough to understand the importance of marriage and must be ready for a life time committed relation. Further, he must belong to a decent family background and should have a good image in the society.

"An open-minded person knows how to take things in a positive way. He takes everything in good humor. They dona??t mind what people say and dona??t take things very seriously even if they are weird. I am one of those people and I know how to get over negative things. 
I have been the same since childhood. My parents taught me how to be open-minded. This has not only helped me in remaining happy but has also helped me in getting in the good books of many people I like. Being open-minded has always been an advantage for me.
Professionally, I am a Software engineer in an MNC and I love my job a lot. I enjoy every bit of it. In future, I would like to stick to the same field and excel in it. 
I have always been a very sincere student. After schooling, I did graduation in B Com and post graduation in MCA from Pune.
I am a person who values her family a lot and I also give credit for my success to my family. They are the ones without whom I wouldna??t have been able to reach this far. My mother is a homemaker and my father is a Business man. I have one sister and she is happily married into a reputed family. 
I like writing poems and I feel very lucky that I can express my feelings in this form. Apart from that, I like to read books and do photography.","The man I get married to must be well qualified and educated as I value education a lot and feel that it is all because of education that a person knows how to behave properly in front of others. This is why being educated is a priority for me. 
When two people get married then a relation is formed not only between those two people but also between their families, therefore, I want that the family I get married into should be very good natured. This will not only make me but also my family very happy. 
He should be very kind at heart and loving, as any girl would like to expect all this in her partner. I will be able to adjust easily if he is like this and if he accepts me with all his love and respect. 
I believe a lot in showing mutual respect and love for one another. I expect my partner to be very respectful towards me and I will have the same feelings for him as well. He should not only respect me but my profession and my habits too. This way we can become an ideal couple. 
I am very modern as a person so he can feel at ease with me. This will avoid many problems between us. I am sure if he is also modern then we can become a wonderful couple. He can trust me with the household work but I will need his help at times. 
I respect the idea of a good friend in a husband. I will love it if he becomes a good friend of mine as I will feel more connected to him this way.","Father-Kokanastha brahmin.age68, retired from statePWD as Secretary to Govt.now practicing actively as consulting Engineer.

"Hi, I am a single female living in Mumbai.  Born in an urban Maharashtrian nuclear family believing in honesty, hardwork and sincerity. 

I am a commerce and law graduate- educated in Mumbai.  I work with a legal firm as a Sr. Associate. 

I enjoy travelling and reading besides going for walks to keep fit (and meeting up with friends if time permits!) .I enjoy watching movies as everyone does!...though i prefer to watch films in theatres!   I love music and i aspire to learn to play atleast one instrument someday! I am an outgoing and friendly person, i am friends with a select few people.   

I would be glad to share more about me ..but later!!","I grew up in an urban Maharashtrian Brahmin nuclear family, and in a partner, I wish to see the familiar with the new.

He should be honest and committed to his work and family. Preferably a post graduate or professional,  he should have positive career prospects or aspirations. 

My future partner should be concerned about keeping healthy, and I therefore hope that he will be a non-smoker. 

It matters to me that he has a serious bent of mind, is able to introspect, likes to read more than biking magazines and cricket columns, and likes to travel (not like the compulsive noisy tourist, but like a quiet traveler, humble before nature). While thoughtfulness and calm confidence are important, what is life without a sense of humour?

"I describe myself as a simple and polite female who likes to be with her family. I like to spend most of my time with my family members. Further, I have deep faith in god and always worship him. He has always guided me to the correct path in life. 
In my professional life I am working as a Company Secretary for Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India. My work has brought a lot of success in my life and I do my work with full dedication and commitment. In the upcoming time I want to be in the same field and reach the top position in life. 
My mother is a homemaker and father is unfortunately no more with us. Somewhere deep in my heart I remember him every day. I have a brother who is currently working with Bharti Airtel as an Assistant Manager. 
In my higher education sector I have completed CS and B Com from Delhi University and M Com from Annamalai University. 
The list of my friends is very short and I like to spend most of my time with them. In my free time I like to listen to music and read books. Further, I like to travel to new destination points and explore the exquisite beauty of that place.","I want my life partner to be simple and decent like me so that both of us can gel with each other. He should have a good sense of humor and must be family oriented. 
I want him to not only respect me but my family as well. This way even I will have no problem in adjusting with his family members. Further, I have no issues regarding the profession of my life partner. I just want him to be well settled so that even my parents are relieved regarding my happy future. 
His family background should be good ad they must have a decent image in the society. Personally I would prefer a man from Delhi/NCR region. One of my major weaknesses is that I am straight forward that goes against me sometimes but I feel proud of it as at least I dona??t talk about people behind their back.
I am ready to share my life with him if he is like the one I have always desired for.

"I am grateful to be blessed with good health, a loving family &amp; a great set of friends. I am a believer in the strength and relevance of family and friends and the strong support system that they provide. 

I have done my Masters in Business Administration and I am a Vice President with a leading global bank. My role as a Corporate Banker is dynamic and challenging and I get a chance to learn something new on a regular basis. 

Apart from work I enjoy spending time with friends, whether its long chats over coffee, catching up on the latest films or leisurely walks at the beach. I also love to read and I'm somewhat of a movie buff. My biggest stress buster is hanging out with my 3 (almost 4) year old nephew. TodayA?s 3 year olds are an entirely different species and I love listening to his refreshing views on everything conceivable. 

I also enjoy travelling, whenever I get the chance. I have traveled to some very interesting places within India and abroad and my favorite places are Goa, London &amp; San Francisco. There can be no end to travel and I hope to see a lot more of this world and its many interesting places and cultures. 

For me God is a form of positive energy. I guess my connection with God is spiritual rather than religious or ritualistic. I make it a point to count my blessings and try and focus on being a good person. 

My life so far has had its fair share of really great times as well as challenges. And I like to think that IA?ve learnt something from every experience. IA?m looking for a partner who can complement me and make the rest of the journey as interesting.

"It is quite difficult to write about oneself but I would like to begin by saying what I feel about the institution of marriage. I feel  that without mutual trust everything else including love is futile in any relationship and trust is what I would expect from my partner. I strongly believe in gender equality and would expect my partner to take as much responsibility of me and my parents and family as he would expect from me. I am a career oriented person and have well decided goals for my future. I am very clear in mind that I would not settle abroad for any reason whatsoever. I love to travel though and have varied interests which include photography and recently gardening. Like any other woman I also enjoy doing home decor and love to collect rare or delicate art works from the places I travel to. I have traveled both in India as well as abroad and believe in taking two trips per year, one for travel within India and one abroad. I am not too spiritual but believe god exists in every little thing that we see around us. I feel there is magic all around us we just need to open our hearts to it, i also strongly feel that whatever happens is for the good and for a purpose which we may or may not understand.

"Well, I hope that this lets you know a little about me, and I hope I don't come across as being too cynical, harsh, or meansounding. I will give anybody the benefit of the doubt (we're all human, we all make mistakes), but I also don't like being taken advantage of. I'm just asking you to keep it real and be honest from the beginning; that way, nobody is wasting their time or getting their feelings hurt. 
I am a Spirit-filled believer in the Lord Jesus Christ, and He is the source and strength of my life. The desire of my heart is that I meet and grow to love the man with whom I hope to spend the rest of my life. If you're really serious and interested in me, let's get serious and take this to the next level. I hope this tells you more about me.

Have a blessed evening and hope to hear from you soon.

"I am a family oriented girl, whose biggest assets are her parents. I have two elder sisters, both are married and well settled. I am down to earth yet adaptable to any situation of life as it comes. I believe that two persons can spend whole life if the relationship is pure and transparent. I believe and look forward to a married life full of love, laughter, peace, understanding and patience. Any relation can be good or bad and that is how you create. Lets belive in GOD and we will get our share.

Note:- Divorced and Separated, kindly excuse.","Well, what should I say..someone with whom you wanna spend rest of the life has to be a companion in every sense. Both of us should be the first one for each other to share every joy and sorrow in life after God and parents coz, no one can take their place. I want to enjoy every part of married life with love and laughter. To start every morning with smile and end the day with a smile, Small things in life makes big difference; be it going for walk together or watching TV together, going for a walk on beaches etc etc.. the list is endless",,,18 Aug 1977,,India,,,,,Arora,,,,,,Self,B.A. (Arts),"36 yrs, 5ft 4in,<br />

"I am a simple girl, who is fun loving and friendly in nature. I am an outgoing kind of a person and like to spend time with my friends. I am a hard working person and believe a lot in god. 
Presently I am working as an accountant and I am very dedicated towards my work. In the upcoming time I would like to be in the same profession. I want to become a successful person in life and attain a reputed position in life. My hard working nature has brought a lot of success and appreciation in my life. 
My strength is my family and I respect them a lot. My mother is a homemaker and father is no more. I have two sisters who are happily married and well settled in their life. 
After my school qualification I completed ms from golden gate university. 
Whenever I get time after my work, I like to travel to new places and explore the beauty of that place. I also like to read books as it teaches me a lot in life and takes me to another world.","I am looking for a simple and an honest person to become my life partner. He should be loyal towards me and our relation. As marriage is a life time relationship therefore it requires transparency. So I want my life partner to share everything about his life with me. 
He should be an understanding kind of a person and must be ready for marriage. I want him to be mature enough to have a broader aspect in life and a positive outlook towards life. Personally I would prefer a decent man from abroad, California.
My husband should be well educated and must be from service class and must be well settled in his professional front. As his family background would be a major concern for my family therefore he must be from a good family background and they should have a good image in the society
If he is like the one I am looking for then I am ready to fill his life with happiness.

"Hi -Searching for a very specific type of guy. My sister is a very adventurous yet kind hearted person. She has grown up in both an Eastern and Western environment and is a perfect amalgam of the two cultures. She understands the need for tradition when it is appropriate but leads a very Australian lifestyle on a day to day basis. She is highly intelligent and extremely athletic. Guys interested in her would need to appreciate these qualities. She appreciates good intelligent conversation as well as the ability to cut loose and have a wild, crazy and fun time. A good and quirky sense of humour is a definite must in any potential partner. She loves adventure sports and travelling the world and you must enjoy this as well. Rock Climbing, Snow skiing and Martial Arts are her particular fortes having reached the pinnacle in all of these but she will try most things even if just for a laugh. When not travelling the world, (she has done everything from diving with great Whites to Everest Base Camp) she is found at home cooking up a storm or baby sitting her niece and nephew who totally adore her. She enjoys the company of her numerous ecclectic friends and easily fits into any social situation or group.
Her ideal partner should be willing to share her life adventures with her and indeed introduce her to many and more fun times. Life after all is meant to be for living!He should be extremely loyal to her as she will be to him. A high ethical and moral standard is a must.

She/We do not believe in the cast system or any such social yoke so if you are into that or dates of birth or horoscopes etc then she is not the girl for you.

She is looking for an equal or better so if you are looking for a ""fair"", ""traditional girl"" with good"" homely values"" then again she is not the girl for you. She respects and ascribes to all of these naturally, but is not constrained by that mindset.

If you are looking for an attractive, athletic girl with an awesome sense of humour who loves living life to the full and extracting every moment of joy that she can, If you want an equal in life and not someone subserviant then she is certainly the type for you.

all profiles with pics or emails with pics included will be replied to - and pending further discussion we will also reply with photos.",,,28 to 40,24 Oct 1977,,Australia,,Athletic,Doesn't Matter,,Hindu-Others,,Others,,Dark ,Doesn't Matter,Sister,LLB,"36 yrs, 5ft 6in,<br />

Further, his family background should be decent and they must be known in the society for their good and well behaved nature. Personally, I would prefer a man from Gujarat.
I have no issues regarding the profession of my husband; he can pursue his career in any field. I would appreciate if he is well settled because it is an eminent factor for me as well as for my parents as in future it will help us in leading a problem free life. 
I assure him a happy future is he is what I want him to be.

"I believe in the 5 D's in life: Discipline, Dedication, Devotion, Determination and Desire. A blend of western and Indian values. I like to live life at it's fullest. Make others laugh with me and enjoy every moment of life. Smile and the world smiles with you. Where there is a will, there is a way. When nothing goes right, when days become night. When hope becomes hopeless, when goals get dim. When the dreams you have begin to shatter. When life in front of you seems like a battle. And everything begins to rattle. When you get numb about anything that happens to you. When some try to shatter you. Hence, when nothing turns right, just remember there is always going to be a ray of light. That will guide you all the way through. So keep your patience and calm and nothing shall be harmed. Trust and believe in yourself, where there is will there is a way. Life is all about loving, caring, sharing and daring. There is a very special place in my heart for homeless children, orphans, mentally and physically challenged children, whom I do give special attention by supporting them in any which way I can, be it spiritually, financially, emotionally, etc. I do spend part of my spare time with them. The feeling is just great.","simple,down to earth,caring,loving,joyous,noble,honest,transparent,ready to help needy,respects for elderly,.who can read my thoughts,my best friend,philosopher &amp; guide,who can use his common sense in uncommon situations.",,28 to 31,06 Oct 1977,14:44:00,India,Vadodara,Average,Athletic,,Shewetamber,Vania,California,,Fair ,Fair,Self,Other Diploma,"36 yrs, 5ft 2in,<br />
