 He must be from a good family background with a good standing in society. This way it will be easier for my family to trust them and be satisfied for my future. 
Further, he should be well qualified because this will help us to understand each othera??s perspective towards life easily. He must give respect to me and my family, this way I will also reciprocate positively.

"Thoughtful, determined and creative are adjectives that sum-up my personality. I am an ardent admirer of nature, and love to spend time
gazing at the horizon across the sea. My passion is to travel wide &amp; far and capture the scenic moments on my cam.. I like good music,
long drives, and quiet moments with
friends and family. In my younger days, I played cricket and badminton for my college, and learnt the violinAA?A. but over the years other
priorities took over, leaving no time for these activities, and what
is left behind is only my interest, which I desire to revive someday.

I am an engineer by qualification, but choose to follow my heart and joined the advertising industry AA?A? a decision I am truly proud of. To
be competent in my chosen field, I did several related academics like brand management, retail management and public relations. Presently, I work with a leading financial services brand in their corporate communications department, and look after their advertising and marketing functions.

As a professional I am ambitious, want to grow and be recognized. In person, I am sensitive, believe in strong family ties and prefer my
independence and identity. I believe that one must maintain a fair balance with quality family time and work. My friends say I am
passionate about things and trust people at their face value. Without sounding clichA?A, commitment and honesty are what I look forward to in
my relationships.

A mumbaiite in true spirit, I am fascinated by the city and enjoy all its nuances. Also like all other mumbaikars, I am bound to the cityAA?A
for here is where I desire to grow and make a difference.

My Job:Work as advertising and Marcom professional for a leading financial services brand.

About Career: Plan to work after marriage.

My Family: Father is a retired scientist from BARC and Mom too from there.Born in a traditional Tamil Iyengar Brahmin family, my father has been a scientist and my mother a working professional - this explains my inclination towards well read men. I am the elder of the two siblings, and my brother is mentally challenged - a result of an unfortunate accident in his early childhood. We are a close knit family.","Looking for: I am waiting for a lifetime companion, who is my true friend and a well wisher. Someone who respects me for being 'Me', stands by my side
Hi or Low, and compliments my thoughts. Educated, ambitious, and above all a great human being with progressive and liberal values. One who laughs away the miseries and brings joy of living in the relationship.

"I grew up thinking that I would be able to describe the psychological, emotional and intellectual aspects of my existence to my man in just a glance. But little did I know about love. So here I am, to try again to look for it through words. 

Confident, smart, optimistic, fun-loving, caring, introvert, witty, aggressive - shaadi.com helped me there! Yes, this is little bit of me. Life is my first love - time and again we break up - only to know more about each other and be friends again. I am a firm believer in values.  

I believe in passion. It drives my life. I find it in relationships, music, sports, books, nature. I love my family and friends. Dont know what would have become of me without them. Any kind of music soothes me - but I mosly listen to hindi music. A game of squash cools me down, lawn tennis is what the summer is all about and I am always ready to race down the road with almost any stranger. I like to read books on different subjects, by different authors. Love going on hikes, skiing on the blues and white water rafting (I love water but have not tried to learn swimming as yet - come on, dont be judgemental!). I have not been around even half the India to call myself a travel freak, but I can put the blame on chance atleast for once. There are places on my to do list that I need to visit one day or the other. I hope I can soon call myself a travel freak. :) As you can guess, I love humour and dogs. Mafia is my most recent craze. 

My friends refuse to comment on me. :( but if you just need that one last push, let me know and I will bribe one of them to speak for me :) I love spending time all by myself as much as I love partying. However, you cant call me either a loner or a socialite. Not a big fan of TV, but I love movies - any genre. Am ambitious to the extent that it does not disturb my balance in life.","I think relationships give meaning to life, be it any. I look forward to marriage in a very unconventional way. The following quote by a famous writer Rilke describes what I feel about it - ""Once the realization is accepted that even between the closest human beings infinite distances continue to exist, a wonderful living side by side can grow, 
if they succeed in loving the distance between them which makes it possible for each to see the other whole against a wide sky.""

I can write pages about myself, as I have already done, but if you ask me about yourself - just a few words come to my mind - You should be smart, witty, intelligent, 
and the one who believes in values and has the conviction and courage to apply them in his life. ",,28 to 38,16 Nov 1975,,India,Meerut,Athletic,,,Agarwal,,,,Very Fair ,,Self,Masters,"37 yrs, 5ft 2in,<br />

"The goal of education is the advancement of knowledge and the dissemination of truth. This is very true and I practice the same. I am very proud to say that I know the difference between being educated and being literate. 
I am pursuing Ph D in Biotechnology and in future, I would like to do research in the same. This is because I want to prove myself and be known and popular in my field of work. I am sure that my dedication towards my goal will one day help me prove something important. 
An example of my dedication is that I topped the entrance exam of M.Sc. in Biotechnology. This was the most important and memorable moment of my life as everyone who cared about me was very happy. 
My mother, who is an Associate Professor believes a lot in me and is sure that I will achieve what I desire. Other that being good in studies I have some hobbies too, like chatting with interesting people. This gives me an insight about people and helps me know about them. 
I am very adaptable to modern ideas and very flexible as a person. I donAA?A?t think I will have any problem in adjusting with people of different nature. If people are good with me, it is not very difficult for me to accept them in my life.","As I said I am into a well-settled profession, therefore I would want to marry a man who is in one of them to. I donAA?A?t want him to be in the same profession as mine but he should be good at whatever he does. 
I am very loving so I would like him to be the same. He should not take much time to accept me, as I am sure I will not take much to make him an important part of my life. 
I am good to talk to so I would like him to be the same. He should be so charismatic that he lures everyone around me. This is because I think that will make us a wonderful couple. Apart from that it is very important for him to be well off as I donAA?A?t want to struggle after marriage. 
I manage to look quite all right so I expect the same from the other end. I donAA?A?t expect him to be a handsome hunk but at the same time should be a pleasant looking man. However, after all he should be a man with a good heart as looks float away but a good heart does not. 
He should be very liberal and as I want him to have no problem with the way, I live my life. Both he and his family should consider my feelings whenever they do something as I will leave my whole family and settle with them. 
With all these qualities, any man can feel free to enter my life as I will also welcome him well and be good to him all my life. ",,,06 May 1976,13:45:00,India,Delhi,Average,,,Khatri,,Delhi,,Fair ,,Self,Ph.D. (Doctorate),"37 yrs, 5ft 6in,<br />

"I describe myself as a simple and down to earth person who is friendly in nature. My deep faith in god has taken me to a reputable position in life. He has always guided me to the correct path in life and has always helped me in solving my problems.
My professional life has always been challenging for me and I work hard each and every day to excel in it. Presently I am in to the boutique business which is my passion and in future I would like to take it to the pinnacle of success. 
There is one major weakness of mine and that is my sensitive nature which at times gets negative for me. The ones who know me well take care of this fact and never make fun of me. 
Our cultural and traditional values are inherent from our parents. They support us in our bad times and help us overcome the difficulties in life gracefully. My mother is a homemaker and father is a businessman. I have a brother who is also engrossed in business and is happily married. 
In my higher education sector I have completed B Com from Delhi University and MBA from IMT Ghaziabad. 
Since my childhood I have a habit of sharing my secrets and feelings with my friends and I follow it till now. I have very few friends in life and I like to restrict myself to them only. With them I spend my time listening to music, travelling to new destinations and watching movies.","Like every other female even I want a man of my choices. I have always yearned for a man who is simple and down to earth. He should be flexible so that he easily adapts according to my family environment. 
I dona??t mind marrying a man from any profession; I just want him to be well settled. As it will be a major concern for my parents as well. He should be a mature person and should realize the importance of marriage. He must also realize that a marriage comes with a lot responsibilities that need to be full filled efficiently. 
My life partner should be well qualified and should belong to a decent family background. Personally I would prefer a man from Delhi/NCR region. As I am a working woman therefore I want my husband to have no objections if I continue to work after marriage. I want him to understand my aspirations in life and support me in fulfilling them. 
If he is like the one I am looking for then he will seek a lot of love from me.

"Its hard to describe about self, but shall try.Believe me, this is not any kind of exageration but  simple truth, coz marriage is a life time commitment.
Well, to start with - I have a pleasing personality( that's what my friends comment) and get along well with people, a bit choosy when it comes to friends coz I am frank and open and hate gossips. I am sincere in my work and well desciplined. My goal in life is to lead a life pleasing to the Lord. 
I am a malayali , born and brought up in MP and my parents have been here in MP for about 45 yrs &amp; they have  No plans of going back to Kerala. They are the members of a christian organization which is a hospital (60 bedded multi speciality hospital ) run by few members and my parents are one among the members. We live in a campus and all the members stay together with their children and grand children as a family. It is not a kind of  posh or luxurious kind of living , but we lead  and live in a simple, humble and christ centered atmosphere.
I did my schooling from a convent in MP and then joined for my professional course( Diploma in Medical Lab Technology ) in New Delhi, completed and then came back to MP and presently working in the same hospital with my parents. I am managing the pathology Department of our hospital. I did my MA in sociology(Bhopal University)while I was working,  as part of my interest to study.
My parents are basically CSI which according to me is just a man made name tag coz God did not create us with labels but created us in His own likeness and image. People probe into many aspects like caste, creed, denomination when it comes to marriage but that does'nt count at all when you enter into the kingdom of God. All that matters is to do His Will. So - Men under parental pressures for money, fame etc -- can exclude me ! The Bible says : 
There is neither Greek nor Jew but Christ is all and in all and we are all one in Him ( col 3 : 11 ) - a person with this motto is wecome to  approach me.
We go to a Methodist Church here for worship coz we have been here since ages.I have been baptized and like to have fellowship with the believers. I can only talk in Malayalam but cannot write or read. I am fluent with Hindi and of course English. I take part in Church activities and do sing in the  church choir.
I like to dress up well. I love to wear Jeans coz I feel much comfortable with that especially for a casual outing / walk in the morning or when I am on my 2 wheeler but not to Church anyway.
I do not know much cooking because we have been brought up in an Organization where food is cooked for all the members together by the cooks appointed and we don't have to do any cooking.But I sure can learn it in the near future.
I am a jovial person and can mingle well if I get a proper feed back. I can make a home  a real sweet home. 
Keeping adjustments in view , I would prefer a life partner who is a Malayali - settled outside kerala like me, who should be a  god fearing christian and  a believer with clean habits and a person who will hold my hand in every walk of  life.I know that when God gives - He always gives the best to His children who put their trust in Him.
I think, I have written loads and should stop now. Rest and next when we meet in person. 
God bless U &amp; your family.","God fearing, well mannered , loving and caring personality who is educated and has a decent job. One who is open minded like me and willing to share feelings in a trust worthy manner. Person who is not demanding  materialistic benefits but willing to adjust with me in any situation. A family who will consider me as their own member  and a family that prays together because I believe that  a family that prays together - stays together.","I am the second daughter to my parents. I  have an Elder sister who is married and well settled in Europe now and have a house in Chennai for their future settlement . My youngest sister is also a professional &amp;  working in our hospital . My parents are involved in all the activities of the Institution. The hospital has got many other activities also  like farm, poultry, etc -- They are involved with the management.

"Its always been a tough job when we are asked to introduce ourselves cos we know so very well about us  and its not that easy to describe us in words for we do not know where to start from. Well when its a must I wanted to give a try so that I may be successful in presenting myself and giving you an idea of who am I. I hope that my try gives you an impression about myself and wish it's not so different from what you have understood.  I am the kind of person who is known for Positive Attitude and for my positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, many places I wish to see, I love nature and I wish to spend a rainy day in a hilly region. I can't take too much cold but I wish to play in the snowfall, I love music and I wish to sing along the melodies. I like to learn and to experience. I like to be alone in my room but little scared to be alone in the house, I like birds and animals and I love to watch them. I am very scared of Lizards and I get on to my nerves when I see them in my house.  I am pretty organized and wish to the things to be its place. I can?t tolerate untidiness and I like to have hygiene food. I like to cook and I like delicious food. I like to wear sarees, other traditional Indian wear but i love to be in formals and I like comfortable and matching sandals. I like painting and Love to watch comedy and romantic and Adventures movies. The very best thing about me I am very jovial and fun loving . And, I like to laugh and I Love to make others laugh. I always make everyone to be happy around me.","I believe that our life partner should be of our own image as we look it in mirror, so if we are nasty and cruel and never understanding kind of person we get the same kind of behavior or similar behavior from our partner, but if we are loving, caring and understanding we will get tonnes of love and care from our partner. So i have no high expectations from my partner, reciprocate to what i am giving that's more than enough for me. If still want to have a clue then I would prefer a partner who understands family values and relationships. True from heart and committed to marriage. And would be more interested in the one who is straight forward, Faithful besides being very loving and jovial.","To be a part of a family like mine is so divine where love is shown hurt is shared. our love for each other is never impaired. we talk we laugh we cry but we are a family and we do it all together for as a family, we do it all as one.

"I was born and brought up in Kolkata. I am very friendly by nature but sometimes introvert. I prefer to call myself as extroverted introvert. I am a self-dependent working woman with pleasant personality, mix of modern as well as traditional values. Believe in three R's: Respect for self, Respect for others, Responsibility for all my actions.Extremely respectful towards the values and virtues of life. As much committed towards work as towards family.","I guess like most of us, we have gone through a phase of life we won?t wish on any one and it?s scary to think of it again. However, being the eternal optimistic I am looking for a person similar to what I am. My search is for a soul mate/companion to complete my journey in life.

"I come from a sweet and nice family of four. Have swam across little tit bits of life with some difficulties and a bit of determination. Am quite ambitious in my own way and largely inspired by mom, brother, nature and of course life. Have seen most of the life's attributes. Dad is a retired army person with his entire life gifted to social work. Mom is a great homemaker. Bro is currently heading sales operation for India in one of the CRM companies and have chosen to create names for all and fame with it. Am a bit moody and quite a lot of time bubbly person. I would like to take life as it comes but yes also expect some tit bits of miracles.",,,37 to 45,09 Feb 1976,,,,Heavy,,,Kshatriya,,"Chennai,Secunderabad,Hyderabad,Bangalore,Thane,Mumbai,Kalyan,Navi Mumbai","Other College, Bangalore University",Whetish Medium ,,Self,PG Diploma,"37 yrs, 5ft 6in,<br />
