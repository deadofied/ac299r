"Hi!
I am an outgoing, creative, social person who enjoys hanging out with friends and trying new things. I love to laugh, make others laugh, talk, listen and have a great time. My interests are varied and I am up for trying anything, at least once. I crave any sort of travel and adventure, even if it's just taking a new route to the grocery store :) I am a huge sports fan and enjoy both playing and watching. I'm also a pretty straight forward person--I call a spade a spade and like others who do the same. 

I have a rewarding career in education. I've taught math, started and run schools and now work as a consultant to school leaders. I love working with children and hope to have my own some day. 

I recently moved back to Michigan after living in Boston, Chicago, and Southern California, where I spent the last 9 years. My work allows me to live anywhere and I am happily, geographically flexible. 

I am the hybrid offspring of a Gujarati Vaishnav Father and Maharastrian Brahmin mother. I am very lucky to have two younger brothers who have trained me well--I know how to take a joke ;) 

All I want is a partner in crime who can make me laugh (even if it's at my own expense--I can handle it,) who has strength, and who demonstrates passion towards life. I am looking for a secure man with strong family values, who appreciates the good in others. A supportive partner who knows what he wants, has ambition and passion, and who lives a balanced life. I can offer all of the same in return. I see life as a team sport and am searching for the ultimate teammate.","I am looking for man who is US-based or who has a strong desire to live in US.  Someone who is happy, close to his family, confident and secure.  He must also have a desire to have children and be a good life teammate.","My father is an engineer by eduction and has a business in the medical industry.  My mother is a retired engineer.

I am a very simple and honest person. I am very sincere and dedicated for my work. Presently I am working as a Senior Analyst in an MNC.,"The choice of correct Life partner should be made carefully as it is a lifelong relation between two people. I want my husband to be caring so that he can take of my likes and dislikes. He should also respect not only me but everyone. This way he will receive a lot of respect from my side. Further, his sense of humor should be great so that we spend a good time together. 
My life partner should have a modern outlook towards life and must have a modern lifestyle. This way it will be easy for me to adjust with him. He should be well settled so that we donAA?A?t face any problem in life.
I want my life partner to be well educated and qualified so that both of us understand each other well. He should come from a good family background and they must have a decent image in the society. I would personally prefer a man from North India who is working and settled in Bangalore. He should be professionally settled in the S/W industry. 
One of my major weaknesses is that I am very straight forward and express myself freely. I want my life partner to be aware of this fact and must understand it. He should see this important factor about my personality. I am sure if he understands this then he will be proud of my nature and he will seek a lot of love and respect from my end.

"People often confuse being simple to being boring. They think that people who are simple dona??t know how to enjoy their life. Well, I want to prove them wrong. I think that the notion that simple people are boring is wrong according to me. 
I can say this with surety because I am myself a very simple person and I know how to have fun. I feel that people can have fun without making things too ugly. Bothering other people and enjoying the moment is not my cup of tea. 
After schooling, I did graduation in BA in Psychology from Swami Vivekananda College, Chembur. After graduation, I did a Course in Travel and Tourism. Currently I am not working. This is because I am a very homely girl and I like to help my family members in household work. 
My son and my parents mean a lot to me and they are my strengths. They are the only people I love and I wish that they always have a very peaceful life. I dona??t want them to suffer as I know how bad it feels. 
I have very few friends and they all are very close to me. I am sure I will be there for them if they need me sometime. 
When I am free, I like to do gardening and listen to music. I also like watching interesting movies.","I prefer marrying a business man. This is because I feel people who are into business are much more open hearted and they know how to tackle difficult situations. I am sure I can spend a good life with a business man and can adjust with him sooner. 
I prefer marrying a man who is well settled in Mumbai. This is because I have been living there for some time now and I like the culture and tradition people follow there. Also, I would like to stay close to my family so that I can visit them whenever I miss them without travelling much. 
He should be very down to earth as I respect people who are so. I am sure he will become my personal favorite if he is down to earth. Apart from that, I want him to be fun loving just the way I am. This way we can spend our life with lots of happiness. 
His family should be well reputed in the society, as my family would appreciate that. This way they can be comfortable with each other and can respect each other. This way they will trust each other and can form healthy relationship with one another. 
I admire the idea of having a good friend in a husband and that is why I want my partner to be my friend first and then become my husband. This will help us in many things. He can win over my trust and we can open up with each other sooner.

"I describe myself as a simple and soft spoken person who is a true devotee of god. Due to my calm and patient behavior, I first analyze the situation and then pass my judgment over it. I always stay polite with everyone which has brought a lot of appreciation from my near and dear ones. 
Currently I am not working anywhere but in future I would like to be the part of a reputed organization and work with full determination. 
My mother is a homemaker and father has taken retirement from his profession, earlier he was working with IIT, Roorkee. I also have a brother, who is an engineer by profession and currently working with Power Corporation, and a lovely sister who is also an engineer and is presently working in a Govt. Organization.
In my higher education sector I have completed Post Graduation from a recognized university. 
There are very few friends in my life and most of my time is spent with them, with me sharing my feelings and thoughts with them. In my free time I like to do gardening and listening to music of my choice. In addition to this, I can very well take care of the household work.","The man, whom I will get married to, should be engrossed in any Business/Profession. I would prefer a man who is engaged in the high standard business including contractor ship. He should be working in India and my personal preference will go for a boy who is working in Uttaranchal, U.P. or Delhi. 
My life partner should be well qualified and must belong to a good and decent family background. This factor will be very eminent for my family as well as they wants me to enter a civilized family. He should be well settled in life as it will help us in avoiding the struggle after marriage. Further, I want my life partner to be in the same profession in which I am. It will help both of us to understand the work style and pressures. 
I want my life partner to be aware of my emotional nature. I just expect him to be little understanding and strong enough to make me overcome this nature. 
If he is like the one I have always desired for then he will receive immense love from my side.

But then at the same time History enchants me, specially ancient civilization. Given a chance would love to visit sites like Lothal, Mohenjodaro, Dholavira, Rome and Egypt. And that too with an equally interesting  partner would be a dream come true!!!  So if you think I am just a romantic by nature, hold on AA?A? Am equally a rational, logical thinking individual. My strength is the values I believe in, instilled in me by my family which act as a beacon in difficult times. So if you think our wavelength matches, hey what are you waiting for, write into me.

"I describe myself as a hard working person who is very sensitive in nature. I like to be near my family members and spend most of my time with them. I am not among those outgoing kind of people and always think of others perspective before mine. I believe in god and worship him with complete dedication. 
In my professional life I am very serious and do my work with full dedication and commitment. Presently I am working as a Manager in ICICI. In the upcoming time I would like to be in the same profession and attain a reputed position in life. I have always maintained a balance between my professional and personal lives. 
My main weakness is that I am very emotional and very sensitive in nature. The ones who are close to me are aware of this fact and never take advantage of my emotional and sensitive nature.
My mother is a homemaker and father is working as an income tax consultant. I have two brothers, one of them is married and working as a Manager in Reliance Infrastructure and the other one is working as a manager in Reliance Infrastructure. I also have a sweet sister who is working as a Lecturer in a college.
After completing my school education I did B Com and MBA from Pune University.
There are very few friends in my life and I love to spend most of my time with them. In my free time I like to listen to music, read novels and watch TV.","According to me a marriage is all about companionship and both of them should be together in their ups and downs. Therefore, I want my husband to believe in this philosophy which will help both of us to gel with each other well. 
I am looking for a simple and down to earth man who thinks and acts practically in life. He should be a family oriented person like me. Personally I would prefer a decent man from Delhi or Mumbai with a positive outlook towards life.
I have no choices regarding the profession of my husband but he should be a well settled person. He should be well educated and must come from a good family background. His family should be well mannered. 
I am ready to spend my whole life with him if he is like the one I am looking for.

"From the girl next door: Looking for my better half. I am sure you are out there somewhere, and with some luck, well bump into each other one of these days..

So who am I???

I was born and raised in India but I have lived in the states long  enough to become a blend of east and west and also maintaining family values. Family and friends are an integral part of my life. I rely on them when in need but I do consider myself very independent and self sufficient. 
I am ambitious and career oriented. I have earned a degree in Computer Science and have worked in the financial industry for over 8 yrs. Though it is not always easy I try to balance my personal and professional life.
I am passionate ab out life and I'm always seeking to try something different. I believe that trying different things in life is a way of uncovering the mystery of life and all that it has to offer. It amazes me how the more I discover about life the more I want to explore it further. I also believe that a positive outlook towards life makes this journey a lot simpler. This attitude helps me in situations when I make mistake, learn from the mistake and continue to work towards becoming a better person.
I strive to maintain a healthy life style. I spend time at the gym but do not confuse me for a health freak. I enjoy eating variety of food as long as it is vegeterian. Apart from working out, I indulge in various activities to stay fit and healthy. However I also like to have quiet days when I would stay home and just chill out -- watch TV or just read a book.","A bell that constantly keeps ringing: You are 32, do you know where your partner is?

So what am I looking for????
I am looking for Mr. Right rather than Mr. Perfect. I am looking for a friend with whom I can have a strong bond based on truth and honesty. I am looking for someone with substance - someone who can compliment me and push me to the next level yet support me in every way. Someone with whom I can be myself and also be able to express myself the way I feel.",,31 to 35,10 Sep 1975,,United States of America,Vadodara,Slim,Doesn't Matter,,Gujarati,,,,Wheatish ,Doesn't Matter,Self,Other School/ Graduation,"38 yrs, 5ft 5in,<br />

"Being down to earth and simple makes a person very genuine and decent. They make any person look more mature and understanding. The reason why I know all this is because I am very simple and down to earth as a person. 
I have been the same for a long time now. I appreciate people who are like this and respect them for being this simple, as I know it is not that easy. In turn, people respect me for being like this. 
I am working in Administration department in a school. I like my job and when I think about it, I get a feeling that I am doing something good by being a part of an organization where people teach. I would like to excel in the same field in future. However, I can stop working if the family I get married to demands so. 
After schooling, I did graduation in BCA from Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar. After that, I did post graduation in PGDCA from Kurkshetra University. I have worked as a Computer Teacher for almost 8 years. 
My mother is a homemaker and my father is a retired Government Officer. I have two sisters. One of them is married and the other one is an MBBS and preparing for MD. I love my family and I am very close to them. I wish to take care of them and be with them for the whole of my life.","The man I get married to must be highly qualified and educated as I value education more than anything else. I am sure if he is educated and qualified, he will seek respect from me. 
He should be well settled. This is because a well settled man has stability in his life. I am sure if he is well settled he will avoid a lot tension and pressure in his daily life. 
He can be from any profession, as I donAA?A?t have any reservation about that. All I expect from him is a good personality and a good nature. This is one thing that will be important in our married life. 
I have few friends and I woulkd like to be with them. I hope my partner does not mind that. I am sure once he spends some time with them he will like them too and will not mind me hanging out with them. 
More than anything else, he should be a good human being. This will not only be important for me but for my family too. They will be more than pleased to marry me to a man like that. 
I have strong faith in Sri Guru Granth sahib ji. I am sure he has selected someone for me and he will help me find him. ",,35 to 40,09 Nov 1975,10:22:00,India,Patiala,Slim,,,Khatri,,Chandigarh,,Wheatish ,,Daughter,BCA (Computer Application),"38 yrs, 5ft 3in,<br />

"Thank you for visiting my profile!!

""Life is like a box of chocolates...you never know what you're gonna get"" - Forrest Gump

Hmmmmmmm.......it's hard to say something but still..........Well I'm into an entertainment industry.

I have been operating our family Video Games parlour.

I'm not into religious activities like prayers, keeping fast etc. For me WORK IS WORSHIP. 

In my leisure I love to compose poems both in English &amp; Hindi. Some of my poems have already been published.

Here, I'm looking for long term relationship.....may be I meet my someone special through this site. I love pets and respect those who hold regard for them. 

Connection is something which works wonders in every relation and it sums up the chemistry between people.

It is the foundation on which every relation stands the chance to survive even the oddities in life.
I'm myself extremely simple.

I can cook but I'm not a chef :) and believe me I'd prove a wonderful and caring future consort.

So, if you like my profile and think that I'm the right woman you are looking for send me an email and I'll reply.

Thanks once again for reading my short (but exhaustive) profile :)

Best of luck in ur search!!","Someone who's really looking forward towards a serious relationship is welcome. Someome who is humorous and jovial apart from being serious towards life.

I'm an easy going, romantic and cheerful by nature. I want my partner to be the same.

I admire nature and have a soft corner for animals.

Sorry mate, move on if u r not of this kinda nature.

"simple, outgoing, honest and down to earth girl who want to enjoy the every bit of life as it comes. I have experienced trying moments in my life. Each one left its mark but then experiences just provide you with the clay by which you mold your being. I have been fortunate enough to be provided with a great deal of material to shape myself as a human being. With every passing moment I have come to understand and appreciate the poignancy of life. I do not accept the inherent duplicity that prevails in organized religion. For me my temple, church and mosque is the world. It does not begin or end at the four walls of a holy shrine. With this in mind I strive to say, do and act as I believe at all times in all places. This allows me to be impeccable and sustain integrity.","I imagine I have an affinity for a person who has boundless enthusiasm, integrity, is personable, intelligent, understanding and confident.
