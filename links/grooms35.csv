Though did not want to become a Lecturer as a first preference, I can't complain :). Fate always plays its hand well. At the end I am happy with whatever I am.

Simple things as gentle smile and caring heart simply bowls me over. I am searching for someone who can be a wonderful friend with me and with whom i can share excellent vibes. I like to travel a lot and would like my partner to join me in the course of rediscovering ourselves. I do not believe in expectations and hence i do not expect anythign but love and respect. I expect my parter to be loving by heart and humble by nature. All i want is a wonderful friend to spend my entire life with.

More than a wife , i am looking for  a companion with whom i can explore life as it is. I love to go out in the evenings and would expect my partner to share my interests with me, and in the same mould i would like to immerse myself in her interests and hobbies.

I would like her to enjoy life in her sphere, would love to share my passion of music , movies and travelling with her. Although i am not too good at domestic chores but i would definitely help her in setting up our abode. I would like to make equal contribution towards her efforts to make our dwelling place a little heaven on earth.
It might sound too fancy but then i always have been aa die hard optimist to the core. When i have spare time with me, i love to write poems and indulge in literary activity. I am fond of animals and though i dont possess any pet of my own, i am open to adopting a pet if my partner so desires.
Ours would be a nuclear family and i would like to take her out in the evening to either socialise or to spend quality time with each other. We all have the dream of finding our ideal match in this world, it might never materialise but that should not stop us from making conscious efforts towards finding a soulmate for ourselves.

"Success always comes to a person who believes to work with sincerity and honestly. 
My case too is not different from it. Being born and brought up in a middle class family, I respect the traditional ideologies of a customary Indian family.

Mahatma Gandhi has been a great source of inspiration to me, for his beliefs in the philosophy of simple living and high thinking. I am a very down to earth man but at the same time quite progressive in my way of thoughts. I like the idea of a nuclear family, not because it is fast becoming popular in the Indian society but because of the privacy and the personal space it offers; which I believe is a dire need in todayÃ¢â¬â¢s fast paced world. 

Another habit which fascinates me most is meeting people, having discussions and sharing my knowledge and experiences with them. I believe that this trait is good for personal development, and I enjoy doing the same. It is always preferable to make friends having identical thoughts and ideologies. My friends consider me a true companion as I am always with them in their good or bad times.  

Apart from all this I like to play games and watch cricket when I get any leisure time.

I believe that being ambitious is quite imperative for an individual to achieve desired objectives.  My long term objective is to establish myself well in my chosen career path so that I can fulfill the needs of my family efficiently.    
 
God is almighty and everyone including me believes in the existence of the god and his divinity. This makes my belief in the institution of marriage even stronger. For me marriage as an everlasting relationship between two souls, mutual faith and understanding between husband and wife are very essential facets of a successful marriage. That is how I think I can be a good husband to my wife.

Ergo, here's who I am!!!!

------

I am a thinking person. I know my mind and am independent; frank; responsible; trusting; trustworthy; and fearless. 
I am firm on my principles, but never harsh in my interactions. I am always up to helping people, but cannot be pushed around. 
I focus my energies on bringing about openness and sincerity in any relationship. I value the genuine empathy, the caring and the sharing that emerge out of such earnestness. 
Traveling is my passion -numero uno. I relish going places; meeting people; and enjoying the sights, sounds, tastes and aromas of different cultures and ways-of-life. 
I take interest in almost all kinds of arts and artistic manifestations - films; paintings; sculptures; dramas; magic; dance forms; literature (both prose and poetry) - and diligently pursue these interests. 
I derive superlative relaxation from listening to music (any time); from singing (often); and from dancing (occasionally). 
I consider myself to be a gourmet and derive as much pleasure from cooking (nothing fancy though - just simple, home-cooked Marathi fare), as I do, from trying out different cuisines or culinary items. 
I am an indefatigable admirer of nature and take special interest in 'People Watching'. I get along well with people and have the tact and humour that make for a good conversation. 
Self-expression and a well-balanced life are the things I am ambitious about and have been in the pursuit of - with reasonable success - which I am determined to keep up. 
As a 'Development Practitioner', my work pertains to 'Public Policy' research and analysis and designing, management and assessment of developmental projects. 
I believe there can be no end to how much and how well one can grow in the right companionship, even as this companionship is mutually cultivated - based on love; meaning; regard; reciprocation; and inspiration.",35,,,,Others,5ft 7in,hydm930636,Spiritual

"Few words about my son

Thank you for stopping by and having a look at my profile.

It's always hard to describe yourself, I am a bubbly and a sociable person, good sense of humour, mix with all ages.

Hobbies I enjoy playing snooker and enjoy watching Hindi soaps as and when I get the time.

1. How they look (Appearance)
This is something that does not really matter to me.
Looks are not what matters, it is what is on the inside, how the person have been brought up within their family life.

2. Age difference (the number of years between ages)
To me, age is just a number six to eight years is the most comfortable for me, but I will consider anyone I feel I have a real connection with.

3. Religion denomination
This is NOT very important to me. I am not going to turn down someone just because they don't attend a mandir, but she has to be strong in her faith.
Don't get me wrong I believe in god and when I get the time I attend the Temple Religion is not forced onto anyone it's our faith and how we believe in it.

4. Financial security (Rich, poor)
Honestly I don't care. I have always wanted to start with absolutely nothing so we knew we love
Each other for us, not for what we have Money shouldn't dictate the two peoples life, as you are marrying someone for who they are and not their wealth

5. Education level (High school, College, etc)
My bride would have to be able to discuss odd topics on at least an intelligent level I would say this requirement would lead to at least High school.

6. Attitudes towards life (Views on politics, issues, family)
I am not much on politics so that doesn't really make much of a difference to me. As long as her moral views are similar to mine. Of course I wanted somebody who wants a family, but I didn't have an ideal number of kids I was shooting for.

It's a dream that needs to be fulfilled together

There's more to me but as stated earlier it's difficult to describe yourself to find out more email me and please provide your contact details so I can contact you.

Thank you",35,Brahmin,Others,,Private Sector,5ft 5in,othm1112608,Hindu

"I believe life is full of adventure, trill, fun, problems & contradictions but you have to maintain a balance. You can not get everything right but you can assess & search anything right from a wrong. No tensions just think; do it or leave it. You must be clear in your thought and everything can be contradicted or can be solved. Full happiness but a bit seriousness. There must be a bundle of hobbies and no boredom but no habit. There is no need to change life but you can change you. It is a matter of approach. Sometimes a negative approach will work. You must say 'LET IT BE'. Excess of everything is bad. But there bust be perfection in everything you do. Besides this, I enjoy going for long walks, journeys, and traveling, adventurous things or just like to try out, when i find something exciting. I tried skeying, balooning, paraglyding, river-rafting etc. I visited many places specially Jabalpur, Amarnath, Kedarnath, neelkanth etc. many times. My date of birth is 15.11.77.

Mild Schizophrenia struck him at the age of 18. Early diagnosis and medication ensured debility well under control. His elder brother is happily married and settled in Canada with his wife and a son. We are in a dilemma whether our son should marry at all. Unable to decide between the parental obligations and the guilt of cheating a girl who would be his wife, we pondered over the issue for 7-8 years. Some of our friends and relatives advised he be married as the debility is not serious in nature. After giving a considered thought, we are now looking for a suitable bride for him. Our son often expresses his desire to marry but we are holding him up. He is honest, innocent, law abiding and a gentleman who would not harm others. He does not smoke and is a teetotaler. He left the job in August 2011. He is uncomfortable working in the company of others.  He has inferiority complex and is self conscious. He drives 2 wheelers, cars, does all his personal works including banking. He maintains good physical health, sees TV programs, is fond of English songs and movies. About ourselves: I am 66 years old and retired and my wife 56 years. We are in good health and have no health problems. Expectations from our would be daughter in-law: Our would be daughter in-law should not a divorcee and can be a widow without children. She could be of 30-40 years, be a Kannadiga. She should be educated, gentle, caring and understanding. She should be able to put up with a gentle and a non violent patient. She could be non vegetarian but not beef or pork eating one. Caste no bar. Future of their married life: If everything goes well, it could be a happily married life. We will ensure them a comfortable life but definitely not a luxurious one. There would be no problem even to bring up their children. ",35,Vokkaliga,"Bangalore, Karnataka, India","Other College, Bangalore University",Not Working,5ft 6in,SMM1456250,Hindu

"Hi.. ! Thanks for browsing my profile. !

 Basically I think that writing all the blah blah here does not make sense till you actually interact or communicate with the person. But to let things roll.. am mentioning a brief picture about me. 

My name is Hrishikesh. I am a grad in Chemical Engg and a post grad in textile design from NIFT Delhi. Currently have just started to pursue my PhD in design from CEPT university. I am an entrpreneur by nature and am putting my efforts to establish an identity for my recently started design studio. 

The rest like hobbies, nature, etc are all very simple and basic that make a human being. I like to be a warm and casual person, enjoy being friends, having a good time with my family. embarking on trips. Moivies, photography and other fields related to design is my passion. In fact I enjoy them more as a sense of activity for engrossment than a moneymaking venture. I am a visual thinker and the, how, what, who, which, when, where, whom aspects of knowledge intrigue me. I do have my ambitions in life but would not loose my calm by being impatient. 

Religion to me is more of a faith in the Almighty and His creations, rather than a dictum to be followed. Though I follow many dictums which have a logic and a deep philosophy to back them. They do have a postive effect on the life that you live. 

About companionshiip in life, well I thiink that its your karma that takes you where you belong. I am a strong believer in exposure and experience in life. Values and perceptions in life are what matter the most. They build up the broad nderstanding. They open up your mind and persona and that helps companions share a mutual relationship, live like buddies in thick and thin making every moment wonderful as time just passes away. , Concern, care, trust, faith and love is how any relationship progresses and every stage triggers a step further experience than the former and surely a better one. 

Phew.. I woudl stll like to reiterate that it would be interesting to interact and find out as the talk progresses rather than develop a judgemental attitude from all this text. After all, we are all looking out for buddies for life.

"What do you say on a forum as impersonal as the internet esp. when you are seeking a soul mate ??... Well you put in what you think is your honest picture of yourself and hope (REALLY HARD) that there is someone out there who is looking for someone like you !!!

So here goes, I am a simple but very liberal (in thought and action) muslim who believes that the religion you practise is incidental to your birth. Dont get me wrong, I am a proud muslim but someone who doesnt quite agree with the picture of the religion that is painted by many a zealot across the world and one who openly defies dogma. Whoops this turned out to be quite a controversial start to my personality. 

Anyway, I am a postgraduate who currently works in the FMCG sector and makes enough to ensure that he doesnt have to go hungry and undertake his other passions - Music and Traveling without having to think about what next? I love traveling, food, reading and music, not necessarily in the same order. I have few but very supportive friends who I know I can wake up in the middle of the night without hesitation and a fantastically awesome family that comprises my two younger brothers and my parents. These are people I can kill for and I know they would do the same for me. As for the rest, I have a lot of acquaintances as part of my job, but then who doesnt in today's world !!!

I am looking for a companion, someone who I can hold a conversation with and not someone who necessarily matches with me on a ""list of criteria met"", cause I honestly dont know who that person and what she would be doing? I am looking for someone who likes whats closest to my heart - Music & traveling coz I would like to share these moments with that special someone (else either the girl would get mad at the constant music playing around in the house or will run away with a more stable stay at home typa guy as I am constantly ""planning"", if not actually on a holiday somewhere). All the rest of it would probably be incidental if we can cross these fundamental but monumental hurdles;-)

"I believe life is full of adventure, trill, fun, problems & contradictions but you have to maintain a balance. You can not get everything right but you can assess & search anything right from a wrong. No tensions just think; do it or leave it. You must be clear in your thought and everything can be contradicted or can be solved. Full happiness but a bit seriousness. There must be a bundle of hobbies and no boredom but no habit. There is no need to change life but you can change you. It is a matter of approach. Sometimes a negative approach will work. You must say 'LET IT BE'. Excess of everything is bad. But there bust be perfection in everything you do. Besides this, I enjoy going for long walks, journeys, and traveling, adventurous things or just like to try out, when i find something exciting.

My family includes my sweet mother who is a housewife. My father is no more with us and I always miss his presence. Further, I have two children, a 3 year old boy and a new born baby girl. For me my children are the greatest achievements of life and I love them the most. 
After my schooling, I completed ICWA from Calcutta. 
Travelling to new places always brings happiness to me and I also like to listen to some great music and watch movies. Further, in my free time I meet my friends and spend time with them.

"I'm basically a fun loving and outgoing personality. believe that everyone has the right to live his/her life in own way and so I respect it. So, I expect that the girl who will come in my life should also respect my view on that. As regards to my qualification, I'm MBA In Marketing & HRM and now doing job at Bangalore As a Area Sales Manager in Berger Paints. I'm well settled professionally and planning to settle in Bangalore for couple of years before I think of some other option :)
I am the Elders in family but probably the tallest amongst all. Since from my childhood times, I have always been fascinated by adventures and thrills in life. Honestly speaking, I feel myself lucky to be born in such a family where there is so much freedom and open mindedness that you never feel burdened by the way life goes. I did my B. com from Purvanchal University. For a year or so, I did my first job in Bangalore. I don't mean to settle for lifetime there but of course for at least some good amount of time. I have seen the life here and hence feel the charm of seeing it more.
My younger brothers are of same lines of thought and attitude towards life. In my professional life, I am always been counted as one of best performer and always maintained good human relationships with my surroundings. I would say, in my life I have seen all possible shades of life and I will always cherish them. For me, my wife is not an exception and hence I would always support and appreciated the life that she wanted to live. I think she will be the one with whom we should sail the rest of life like friends who tender each other feeling and trust and always cherish the time we had together. As mentioned earlier, I am the person who would be glad to offer as much respect and value to my in-laws and would expect the same from her as these are the people who has gives us an opportunity to see this world like a great explorer. Finally, you can take me as the person who can extract the best time out of you and like to hear from you at the above-mentioned correspondence.

So I would request to reader of my profile to know me and my qualities first then take any decision. My Name is Vivek and I am very simple person believe in hard work and doing all things perfectly.
I am a family devoted person so most important I would love to marry a girl who understand family values. I am working in Germany since last 2 years and I am still a pure Indian and strongly believe in Indian culture. That is why I want to settle in India in near future after getting good experience and exposure from abroad. I am not influenced by western culture but yes I learnt lot of good things from people here like...punctuality, honesty, politeness, how to be independent, straight forwardness etc etc. Of course staying away from home made me good cook also. In addition to that I am a sports loving and fitness freak person. In fact sports is one of my favorite hobby. In my free time, either i like to play out door game or spend time in gym. I play many out door games but Tennis, Cricket and Badminton are my most favorite. In additions to that dance(party dance for fun only) and listening music are my other interests.
I hate castism (which is still one of major base of setting marriages in India), dowry system and also relationships made without agreement of parents and couples, specially ignoring girl's choice.I believe that marriage is not only a relationship between husband and wife but it should be a healthy and strong relationship between two families.
I did Masters in Biotechnology which one of the most recent, upcomming and highly applied feild of science, and then I did my doctorate (Ph.D) in Molecular bacateriology (Clinical feild) from PGIMER Chandigarh.
Working as Medical Biotechnologist in one of the prestigious research institute in Germany where i am having good exposure in the feild of genetic engineering and learning new biotechnological techniques . My job is stable in Germany but still I would like to settle in India. I came here for good exposure and expereice, which has boosted my career prospects in India along with my skills.

"Born and brought up in Delhi in a nuclear family, I have grown up with friends from diverse cultural backgrounds each of whom played a positive role in transforming my persona and in making me the person that I am today. I have come to appreciate the fundamental values such as honesty, compassion, integrity, trust and mutual respect which have been the common thread running through all the close bonds that I have shared and which I feel should be the cornerstone of any human relationship. I was always academically inclined and have a creative bent of mind. After completing my post graduation in Economics from India's premier institute, I have been working in the field of analytics and statistical modeling. I have chiefly worked in the domain of Catastrophe Risk Modeling which is a niche area with a focus on natural catastrophes such as earthquakes and hurricanes. I have also briefly worked in the field of marketing analytics. I am a dreamer and believe that we are born to chase our dreams.
